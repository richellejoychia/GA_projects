       " \"Very cold hands and feet while anxious Hey, so I have this problem for quite some time. It all started 3 years ago, somehow I just got more depressed, stressed out and tired, bored with my life, thinking about all existential things and such, half year ago I even had quite strong panic attacks and now I am already in a better circumstances I don't get them that much anymore, however I still get anxious a few times in a week, slight anxiety which is manageable. And what I found throughout these years that whenever I find myself in a panic attack, anxious or such I always get cold hands and feet, and I never had that in my life, all my life I was very active and was working out 4-5 times a week at the 16-28 age range. And at 28 this is where I drastically stopped exercising because all that depression thing and uncomfortable feeling overall, and all other classical symptoms of anxiety, depression...\\n\\nI wonder do do you guys who have something similar like me, had cold feet and hands? The strange thing once I feel better and panic attack or anxiety goes away I almost feel immediately better my hands and feet get warm like they supposed to, because it was normal for me all my life, except those past 3 years.  \\n\\n\\nThe thing is hands and feet get crazy cold like I could put on wool socks, and it wouldn't make any difference feet would still be extremely cold, but once I feel better and get that mental clarity temporarily back I can clearly feel how my hands, feet change temperature I even feel that transition where my feet get sweaty in socks because it was cold a few minutes ago and now it's getting warm, it's like I feel water condensate building up in my socks, because of a drastic change. I am planning to check my thyroid. The last time I checked my blood was 4 years ago and it was all good.\",\n",

       " \"I'm too scared of college, here's why: Sorry, I'm new to posting so if this is not how to post by using text I am sorry.\\n\\nHello, I (20) am currently very afraid of starting up college again in January. I switched majors twice because I didn't know what to do, and am at the moment taking a break until January. I secretly don't want to go to college, but my parents keep urging me. I understand education is important in today's economy, it's just that I am too scared. Back in high school, I failed my final math exam twice and my final history exam. It wasn't just me though, it was nearly my entire senior class, and due to so many fails, we were granted a graduation regardless. Why am I mentioning this? Well, during that time, I was really tearing myself down for not being good enough. I developed severe testing anxiety to the point where on the second attempt for my math final, if I didn't know how to solve a problem, tears would blur my vision. It was way too much for me to handle.\\n\\nI cannot handle dealing with multiple projects or assignments at once. I noticed that when I was majoring in graphic design. The more work piled up, the more I would cry at night. I switched to animation, and not to anyone's surprise, was too overwhelmed by how much I had to do. I've tried planners. I've tried going by a small list, yet nothing was helping me. My college DOES have an option for exploratory, which is where you take all sorts of different classes to figure out your major without falling behind. I would take that, if only I wasn't so scared of failing to the point I can't graduate. In summary, I have a severe fear of college and really don't wanna attend, but also don't want to disappoint my family.\\n\\nAgain, I know education is important to today's society, however I don't think I'll be able to fit in any longer. I don't want a repeat of my high school senior year.\",\n",

After being certain my dog was safe in the car (air con on, in shade, etc.) a brutal anxiety attack was triggered after some lady came into the store I was in (it had been less than 4 minutes - I had my stopwatch going) and started lecturing me on leaving dogs in cars in heat. She was, of course, perfectly correct and I feel the same, that’s why my girl was safe and cool and I was going to be away about 4 1/2 minutes. BUT. Could I handle it like the mid-40’s peace loving, vegetarian then vegan since 2007 so I don’t hurt any animals by my food choices, years of working therapy person that is literally only alive for that girl (12 years together and counting) and would die before letting harm come to her person that I am? Nope. Panic hit like a lightening bolt, I told the lady (that - again - I completely agree with!!) to go die then drove home (probably should not have but I didn’t know how bad it was going to get) with it escalating. I ended up with my face getting tingly from lack of oxygen and it took over an hour to come down. Now I have panic attack hangover and guilt (she was RIGHT! I could have just explained that I agreed with her and while my girl is safe, many others aren’t and I appreciate her looking out for them). I hate that this happens.

       " 'Somehow convinced myself I had sepsis I have a broken third molar. I\\'ve already received a course of antibiotics about two weeks ago and I\\'m due to have it extracted on Wednesday. However, my dentist tried to pull it twice, but I\\'d beg her to stop because I couldn\\'t get numb and she refused to give me more anesthesia. So there has been quite a bit of trauma to the gums.   \\nFast forward to last week, my throat started to hurt. It felt dry, and everytime I swallowed it felt like I was swallowing barbed wire. My tooth was fine though, it didn\\'t hurt. Yesterday, however, I started getting a bit of a temperature.  \\nFor context: I live in the Philippines and I have had dengue before. One of my first symptoms was a sudden onset of fever and fatigue. I worried it might\\'ve been that, but I didn\\'t have the usual headache and I didn\\'t feel THAT tired.  \\nThen I thought of sepsis. Then I started googling. Just like that, I started getting \"chills\" and felt an impending sense of doom - the world around me suddenly felt muted and my heart seemed to quiet down in my chest.  \\nTo make matters worse, I practically live alone. I considered waking up my landlady, or calling my mother, but I didn\\'t know what to do or say since technically...this didn\\'t feel like an emergency.  \\nAt around 9:30 P.M. a car rolls into my landlady\\'s driveway - it\\'s her son and daughter in law. Her daughter in law was wearing a nurse\\'s uniform and I felt better almost immediately. I asked to borrow a thermometer, found out my temperature was barely a fever (37.1°C, or 98.7° F), and received a packet of paracetamol. I didn\\'t actually have chills - I essentially just scared myself into thinking I did.  \\nI felt better immediately, and today I woke up and still had a bit of a temperature, but my throat doesn\\'t hurt anymore and it feels like I\\'m well on my way to recovery.   \\nAnyway, I have got to quit googling.  \\nI still don\\'t know why I had/have (?) a fever. I walked around in the blazing afternoon heat and immediately went into an air conditioned building cold enough to give me chills, so maybe that could\\'ve been a factor. Maybe I just caught a bug. Maybe all the stress to my tooth has initiated an immune response from my body. I don\\'t know what it is, but I\\'m just glad I feel better today.',\n",

Because of this whole incident I have been dealing with EXTREME anxiety and I have a full blown panic attack every night. Tonight I was thinking about smoking weed, which I haven't done since all this started.

I like the idea of playing sports, I'm a naturally competitive person who likes to win, and I like the idea of being on a team. However, I'm not sure if I should even play sports, because it involves a lot of communication with teammates and coaches, and I'm kind of a quiet person and don't like to talk much. Also, I get really nervous at tryouts, I get nervous even thinking about it, and I feel like I suck too much at the sports I like (basketball, volleyball). I get embarrassed really easily, and always sort of feel dumb whenever I do..pretty much anything. I also feel like I wouldn't be good even if I did make a team because I'd play badly due to the anxiety of a lot of people watching, and stuff like that. I don't know if I actually have anxiety, the doctor said it's a possibility, and I've sort of shown signs of it from around age 9, in the 4th grade, when I would often become lost in thought and sometimes fear over things I don't want to mention because I don't want to trigger anyone. Is sports just not for me, or is there some way I can get around this?\",\n",

       " \"Hypochondria: Very tiresome to deal with.. Over the past few years I've experienced multiple anxiety-induced symptoms that it's really becoming tiresome to deal with. I'm not the type to run to a doctor whenever I feel something foreign, but the times I did visit my GP I always felt like I was putting up an act as every single test I've done showed that there was nothing wrong.\\n\\n**A few examples of what I've experienced:**\\n\\nI've had horrible pains in my stomach/intestines for months on end with no clear cause, I thought it might have been, Crohn's disease or something reflux-related. I visited my GP, was referred to the hospital to have them check my throat and also my intestines. The doctors found nothing out of the ordinary.\\n\\nThese pains disappeared out of nowhere and meanwhile I've been telling everybody at work about the pains I was experiencing and sometimes they ask me if I'm still dealing with it and it just feels like I've been lying to people this whole time.\\n\\n\\\\---------\\n\\nWhenever the glands in my neck grow in size I keep touching them, go around my throat and think I'm feeling something abnormal and instantly start worrying that my throat will lock up which then suddenly feels like it's actually happening. \\n\\n\\\\--------\\n\\nA period of time I thought I was malnourished and not getting sufficient amounts of vitamines/minerals, I had my blood tested and all values were in a normal/healthy range. I was baffled at the results as I really felt like I was low on something.\\n\\n\\\\--------\\n\\nAfter having slept with somebody I was overly worried about contracting an STD, ended up getting several tests with months in between to make sure I was not positive for something, all of the tests were negative.\\n\\n\\\\--------\\n\\nDuring the pandemic, I got myself a Pulse Oximeter and got somewhat addicted to testing myself at random points of time, at times I worried my oxygen levels were noticeably low and when it hit 94% a few times I started panicking and hanging my head out of the window to breathe in big gulps of fresh air.\\n\\n\\\\---------\\n\\n  \\nHowever the worst thing to occur is when I **read about some ailments** in the news, for example an hour ago I read about a British guy that perished in Mexico after eating a burrito that apparently had sesame seeds in them. But not long before that I was eating nuts myself so I immediately started to feel like my face/throat were swelling up after reading that article. I am aware allergies can happen later in life so I was instantly worried and started looking up where I can get myself tested for food allergies. Another example of this is reading about people having heart attacks, then I feel pressure on my chest and one of my arms start feeling numb/painful.\\n\\nI do think I'm more prone to experiencing these things late at night, when everybody is sleeping and I might be completely helpless if something were to happen. Considering I have always been a late sleeper this makes it significantly worse.\\n\\nAnother side-note is that I've seen my sister almost choke to death from eating a candy during my youth, this has crippled me for countless of years as eating any food makes my anxiety flare up and feel my throat locking up as I've developed a fear of choking in food. This fear in the first year of dealing with it was the worst, I ended up eating just porridge, mashed potatoes and other food that doesn't require chewing. The worst part was that I actually had a cloth besides my bed where I would spit out excess saliva because I was fear I would choke in it during my sleep.\\n\\nI gradually got better at eating other kinds of foods but during the pandemic this fear started growing again, not as bad as my first year of dealing with it but definitely noticeable especially combined with the fear of my throat locking up.\\n\\nIt's likely something hereditary as my mother has a wide variety of anxieties/fears for various things such as traveling by car or train. Even if you can get somewhere by car/train within 10 minutes, she would travel by bicycle even if it takes her an hour or longer. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing considering cycling is healthy,  but still.\\n\\nThere's many more examples like the one's I've listed unfortunately...\",\n",

I told them that I didn’t actually like them and I hoped that going back on my meds could actually help me make new friends for that reason, and the only reason I haven’t left them already was because I struggle with actually maintaining friendships and even getting the motivation to meet new people, and if I had that motivation I would’ve been long gone.\\n\\nI think the one that made the original comment thought I was joking, but the other friend who owned the group-chat swiftly told me that they were banning me.

My brain (to put it lightly) just couldn’t handle the side effects. I remember going to my intro to early childhood education class thinking people were staring at me even though they clearly weren’t. I would skip class just to avoid the constant fear of thinking people might be staring at me. I would have either panic attacks or seizures in my sleep, and at one point even believed that a guy I liked was stalking or following me. I even slept for 36 hours straight once. \\n\\nI clearly was unwell, and I explained this to my psychiatrist. Instead of taking me off meds, he would put me on different meds which oftentimes would cause even more adverse effects. The hallucinations and adverse side effects went on for about 2 years before I finally quit everything because I was physically becoming sick, and was at my wits end.\\n\\nI’m really concerned and scared to go back on medication because for whatever reason my brain just can’t handle most medications.\\n\\nHas anyone ever been faced with this type of predicament, and what did you end of choosing or deciding?

If you feel anxious, try this deep breathing excersie: Inhale to the count of five and exhale to the count of five. Repeat this three times. This will help calm the fight or flight reponse.\\n\\n2. Take care of your physical health. Eat well, sleep well, excersize wisely. This may sound trite, but each of those activites will calm your nervous system.\\n\\n3. Remind yourself of what\\'s working in your life, whether it\\'s your job, relationship, friendships, children..... or the things you enjoy. :)\\n\\n4. Take action on an issue that\\'s important to you - maybe your road needs a speed bump to make things safer, or maybe the library needs more funding. The answer to hope fatigue lies in thinking about what you can do rather than what you can\\'t.\\n\\nLastly, regarding the news: [https://www.verywellmind.com/is-watching-the-news-bad-for-mental-health-4802320](https://www.verywellmind.com/is-watching-the-news-bad-for-mental-health-4802320) \\\\- Try and be careful of what you read, BTW. I trust Media Bias/Fact Check, AdFontes and AllSides to tell me what I should read.\\n\\nAnd about analysis/opinion: [https://thespeakernewsjournal.com/difference-news-opinion-analysis/](https://thespeakernewsjournal.com/difference-news-opinion-analysis/)\\n\\nMuch love to you, and be well and happy, my friends.

At this point I just want it to be over. I’m so tired, I feel defeated.

I heated the water tank to 60C for a few hours and at the beginning  it smelled like eggs, but the smell went away. Since when I first moved  in that happened (it hadn't been used for years) and went away, I just  thought it was the same as that. [Unfortunately there is no chlorine used in Berlin's tap water.](https://www.bwb.de/content/en/html/1583.php)\\n\\nHowever,  I took a shower without running the hot waterbecause I mistakenly  thought it went through the same pipes as the cold water and noticed the  water smelling a bit, but not sure if it smelled because I had just run  the cold water for a bit. Now I'm terrified of getting bacterial  meningitis or that brain-eating amoeba. I just can't handle the thought  of dying and am incredibly scared.\\n\\nAre  there any fact-based resources I can read or anyone who can help  reassure me that the likelihood of this happening is remarkably small?

I've been there for him throughout, I've also frozen up and missed/bailed on important things or travel in the past, I know exactly what happened and why he couldn't travel. I do not hold him at fault. However, following that, something else went wrong as well and it has prevented him from recovering from the initial episode. He has not had such a situation in years based on my knowledge. He is much much better and coping very well in the last few years. However this travel thing screwed things over.\\n\\n\\nBased on discussions with friends and a post on reddit, I was able to realize we don't have a lot of romantic/sexual stuff between us. We're more like best friends who care for and love each other. I don't know if that's what I want in a relationship since we need to actually see if we work together in person and then move ahead from a virtual, long distance thing to an actual thing and set things up for moving, work, etc. Because of the travel thing getting cancelled, I've been left all alone for 2+ weeks with nothing and my anxiety is building up. I have felt/am feeling everything from anger, rage, shame, embarrassment to pity and the whole package that comes with self-loathing.

He has no idea if and when he'll be coming here. We haven't even been able to talk about it. I don't know what I expect from him, I wanted him to travel ASAP and spend what ever time he has with me but if I raise this point, it feels like I'm pressuring him when he's vulnerable and not in a good place emotionally. \\n\\n\\nI'm utterly heartbroken, alone and spiralling.

While I was walking I noticed that my usual suspicious and self-defeating outlook had all but disappeared. While my mind wasn\\'t exactly focused on the tension of holding in pee, the pressure served as a kind of calming background noise that took a little mental weight off me. Anyway, I got home and decided that I would see if I could replicate my findings at work the next day. \\n\\nAfter waking up I peed, but from then till about 15:30 I did not. By that time I had a very full bladder and had to make a decision as to whether I should let it all out. I decided against it and kept about as much there as was tolerable, but enough that I would still think under normal circumstances that \\'yes, I need to pee.\\' So what happened during the day that informed this decision? Well, surprisingly I was able to replicate that peace of mind I had the day before. Nothing magical, no, but the effect was noticeable. I found myself less disturbed at work by anxious thoughts and I was able to distance myself from them with a kind of calm attitude that was very unusual for me.\\n\\nThe rest of the day went just as smoothly and I did a \"full release\" before going to bed. That day was just over three weeks ago. Bar two or three times when I accidentally let go completely, I continued the experiment with pretty astonishing results. While of course there were escalations in anxiety here and there, my base level anxiety seemed to be reduced all-over. How can this be explained? My idea is that because the two things at play (urination and the anxiety response) are both highly primitive mechanisms of animal bodies, part of the nervous system is occupied with whatever happens when I retain urine, resulting in a reduction of overall anxiety.\\n\\nWhat do you think of this strange practice?

I am usually a very positive person, very cheerful and have many good friends and family but there is something that has been crippling my life since I was very young and that is my panics attacks. This year I started going to the gym and started new personal art projects that include making art with graphite and also streaming on twitch, but sometimes I get panic attacks out of the blue and I can breathe at all, my chest, head and back hurts so much that I have to lay down for hours and stop what I am doing. I had many exciting projects that I wanted to start. I have also been invited to friends events but I had to stop all of it because the anxiety and panic attacks I get wont let me do anything. It would be easier to manage if the anxiety didnt turn into actual physical pain. But the issue is that if I am standing up, I start getting a panic attack out of the blue and my chest gets a horrible sharp pain that lasts for like an hour. It is only when I lay down that it will calm down. So today I have been on my bed for more that 18 hours, I did stand up some hours ago but I started getting a panic attack so horrible that I literally couldnt breathe. My brother helped me to calm down with some techniques. To make matters worse, I have asthma and that makes the problem even worse. My alergiologist refered me to a cardiologist just in case, but she told me the main problem is that because I have asthma and anxiety, the panic attacks just get worse when I am trying to catch some air. I am going with a psychiatrist and a psychotherapist but I havent seen much of an improvement. What makes me sad is that I actually had fun projects to work on, friends to see, places to go, but I cant do any of that anymore  because I cant breathe and get panic attacks multiple times a day. I am walking down the street and I start to have breathing issues and thats when the panic attack starts. I had to get some sick days off work because I cant literally work anymore. Today I cried because I am frustrated, I dont know how to stop them. They happen out of the blue, even if I am just chilling on my computer and watching vids. I was wondering if anyone has gone through something like this, will I die if this doesnt get fixed? I feel that these are my last days on earth because every day it just gets worse, I get more panic attacks, more breathing problems, chest pain, lung back pain, lower back pain. I am very scared and just wanted to know if this is a sign that I am maybe slowly dying?

I’ve been on 2 dates my whole life  and I guess I just got too anxious to set up a 2nd one with one girl, the other tricked me into going on a date with her and I left. I’m still a virgin because of this and I wouldn’t say I’m super unattractive or an asshole. I’m not some weird incel, I’m a progressive politically and socially, politics are one of my big interests and I personally can’t stand incels.

I have a lot of interests like playing music, sports, reading, etc. I feel like I’m as normal as normal gets. I don’t ever get the impression that I’m some kind of outcast. I have a lot of friends male and female. But something about going on dates and meeting women I might be attracted to scares the shit out of me. I get self conscious, I think I’m just not good enough. I need to work out more, be funnier, etc. Then even when I feel better about myself I set way too high of standards, it has to be someone who I think is really attractive, it has to be someone who’s smart, funny, ambitious, etc. And even when all that criteria is met I still get terrified to actually go meet them. And then when I did I was terrified to make a move. I didn’t even touch this girl when I went on a date with her and I feel like it went really well I mean she messaged me after. \\n\\nThere will be women I really like and I’ll be too scared to make eye contact or I get too anxious to remember what I wanted to say.

       " \"Went from multiple panic attacks per day to none at all 2 years ago, I fell into a deep spiral of anxiety, panic, insomnia, and depression. For weeks, everyday I was consumed by non-stop anxiety and panic. I couldn't eat, think, sleep. I was in hell. So I started avoiding things that made me anxious, and my world started to shrink. I didn't recognize myself at all.\\n\\nGoing on medication (Mirtazipine) was my first step to recovery. This helped bring me back to my baseline. I was finally able to get some sleep and started to feel stronger. But it didn't get rid of the anxiety completely, and most importantly, I was still avoiding triggers!  In short, the pills helped calm the symptoms, but they didn't get rid of the root of my anxiety. Which is the fear of fear.\\n\\nThe second step to recovery was facing my triggers/the things I was avoiding. This was hard. But I had a great therapist, and we tackled all of them in baby steps. I slowly learnt to face the panic as it came and went like a wave using a technique called Radical Acceptance. \\n\\nThird step, continue to do things I love, even when I'm anxious. When anxiety would hit, I used to curl up in a miserable ball + cancel plans, etc. Now, I acknowledge the anxiety and discomfort in my body, but my life is not ruled by it. I try to continue to live my life and do the things I love even, when I'm anxious. This is easier said than done, but it works. \\n\\nUltimately, the most important factor in my recovery was learning to sit calmly with the anxiety and giving myself self-compassion. I used to react to panic with more fear and resistance. And beat myself up. This was what was keeping me stuck. Let go of the resistance and magic will happen, I promise!\\n\\nNow I am off the medication. I still experience anxiety, because I am human! All humans have anxiety. But it is much more manageable. And yes, I do occasionally still get higher anxiety or sleeping problems, but when I apply the strategies I learnt, it passes quickly.\\n\\nIt's been a difficult journey, but it is possible to break the disordered anxiety spiral.\",\n",
       " 'Is there any anxiety medication with no withdrawal symptoms? I have found some \"non-addictive\" anxiety medications such as SSRIs, SNRIs, Vistaril (Hydroxyzine), Buspar (Buspirone), and Beta-Blockers. But, although they do not exactly generate addiction and are not habit-forming (due to the lack of physical and psychological dependence), they still can produce withdrawal symptoms when stopped, even if tapered.\\n\\nI\\'m looking for a medication that helps with my BPD and PTSD symptoms (which I have had for six and one years, respectively), such as Anxiety and panic attacks (accompanied by diarrhea, headache, and indigestion), intense and overwhelming emotions, emotional dependence, derealization, suicidal impulses and attempts, self-harm, mania, cyclothymia, difficulty eating, and extreme fatigue.\\n\\nI saw no improvements with Remeron (Mirtazapine, 15mg/night), and also afraid of its withdrawal symptoms, so I took it for two months, and when I could\\'ve taken the decision of either increasing the dose to 30mg/night or to stop taking it, I decided to tapered it on my own for one month (11.25mg/night, 7.5mg/night, 3,75mg/night, each one for ten days) with no significant withdrawal symptoms.\\n\\nNow, I am interested in low doses of Quetiapine (Seroquel, 25mg/night), which can help me with anxiety, sleep, emotional regulation (hopefully killing my feelings), cyclothymia, derealization, diarrhea, and appetite, although I am concerned about its side effects regarding my prediabetes, neutropenia, and its interactions with Accutane (Isotretinoin, irregularly 20mg/day). Mainly with the latter, which I have been taking for about a year and a half and have shown to increase my liver enzymes (fortunately without having taken them out of the normal ranges yet). When the day of tapering arrives, I plan to do it by reducing 25% of the initial dose every two weeks, that is to say: 18.75mg/night, 12.5mg/night, 6.25mg/night, each one for fourteen days, although I am still very afraid of withdrawal symptoms, especially with diarrhea.\\n\\nI\\'ll probably give the low-dose quetiapine a try as it fits very well with the results I want to achieve. Especially that my diarrhea is normalized, and my emotions are completely turned off, since I have to leave my abusive girlfriend on whom I depend emotionally, and she is bringing me serious problems, not only mentally speaking, but also regarding the illegal drug market, which I don\\'t want near myself nor my family. The tapering plan seems to be viable, and it may even be possible to stop taking cold turkey as it is a very low dose (according to: [https://deprescribing.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AP-deprescribing-algorithm](https://deprescribing.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AP-deprescribing-algorithm) \\\\-2018-English.pdf), although I won\\'t do it that way and will execute a propper very safe and conservative tapering plan.',\n",

I politely declined and said I had homework (which was true), but it really made me think about the fact that I don\\'t even really know this person and knowing them isn\\'t even one of my priorities right now, but they still want to know me. As far as I\\'m concerned, I don\\'t even want to be close to this girl yet. I\\'m happy with the way things are in my life, and dealing with a lot of it changing is already difficult. I don\\'t want anyone else in the picture until I can sort my crap out. But anyway, like I said, I became less motivated to manually stop specific things in my life from changing and definitely a bit less self-aware of how things were changing, so I made friends. But now that I am more self-aware of all this again, I feel like I began digging a hole, and now I can\\'t stop. My brain really said, \"Okay I gave you a head start in your new social life, you gotta do the rest of the work.\" Which I don\\'t want to do anymore. I\\'m happy when things develop and change slowly, but over the last few weeks, I\\'ve ditched that mindset, and now I\\'ve made the subconscious decision that I have to force myself to adapt to all these new things, when I don\\'t want to; it\\'s draining. And the worst part about fearing change, is that you don\\'t want to change the fact that you\\'re afraid of it.',\n",

I mean the entire day.\\n\\nThis went on for two more days until I called an ambulance.\\n\\nI have agoraphobia and the last place in the world I\\'d want to be is accident and emergency where I had to wait for 15 hours. This just goes to show how desperate I was.\\n\\nThey ran blood tests, multiple ECGs, physical exams, asked me everything about my symptoms multiple time.\\n\\nI told them that there is something physically wrong. I have never felt like this, and it won\\'t turn off. I burst into tears telling them there is something seriously wrong. I kept repeating it over and over that even though I had no racing heart, no palpitations, no sweating, no hyperventilating, that I was dying.\\n\\nI had an amazing doctor, she also ran everything past her registrar. They did a blood pressure test whilst I was stood up when I said I felt like I was going to collapse. Blood pressure completely fine. Everything was completely fine.\\n\\nI spoke at length with this doctor, whilst sobbing my heart out, telling her there is no way this is anxiety, there is no way this can be like this for three or four days.\\n\\nShe heard everything I had to say. And this is how she replied.\\n\\n\"This is your mind, your mind is incredibly powerful, your physical symptoms are 100% real, but there is no physical cause for them. I completely understand how terrifying this must be for you. But I promise you, that anything that could be physically causing your symptoms is negative. I completely believe you, and you need mental health support right now.\"\\n\\nShe booked the mental health team to come and see me a few hours later. They confirmed everything the doctor said, I checked with them again, asked them about all the health symptoms I\\'ve had over the last few months. Again, yes, depression and anxiety can cause all of these symptoms.\\n\\nI went home, still feeling the way I felt, I only slept out of pure exhaustion. I woke up after four hours and the feeling was gone. Over the next hour or so, my appetite came back and I felt okay. I ate so much food!\\n\\nRight now, the feelings are starting to creep in again, and I know my mind is going to try and tell me that they missed something or they didn\\'t run the right tests, but if I repeated what I did yesterday and went to the hospital, I\\'d be left with the same result.\\n\\nLong story short, I never understood until yesterday how powerful the mind is, I still can\\'t understand it. But, its true.\\n\\nSo I hope this reaches someone who is feeling utterly helpless.\\n\\nI essentially had a breakdown, and the power of the anxiety managed to turn off my appetite and make me nauseous and vomit for three days. Also, made me unable to stand despite my blood pressure being completely fine.\\n\\nIf you have any questions, please ask me. I guarantee you that any symptom you\\'ve got right now, I\\'ve had.',\n",

       " 'Angry Anxiety Hello all,\\n\\nMy life has run smack into a brick wall, and it\\'s 100% my fault.\\n\\nI [32M] have been married for right at 8 years with a 6 year old son, and I think I have finally pushed her too far.\\n\\nLong story short, I was a \"gifted\" child and had a father constantly telling me how much smarter I was than everyone around me from as early as I can remember. Early school was a breeze and I was able to breeze through tests with zero effort outside of halfway paying attention. Unfortunately, this apathetic approach led to a decline in my academic performance in middle and high school, which in turn exacerbated my feelings of inadequacy and (as I\\'m finally ready to admit) anxiety. I\\'ve had mild panic attacks for at least 20 years now that I tried to convince myself was an abnormal heart rhythm to avoid admitting that I had a problem that I couldn\\'t control with pure will power, this is an issue of mine resulting from negative side effects I experienced from age 4-18 when I was prescribed amphetamines for my ADD. I\\'ve spent so much time trying to run away and hide from my own feelings that I\\'ve subconsciously come to resent myself, which has in turn caused me to fall into a trap of channeling that anxiousness into anger. This is how I\\'ve torn apart my marriage and my family.\\n\\nI won\\'t go into to many details, but my wife and I are currently separated and that space has forced me to have to try to confront these feelings as I can\\'t do what I used to and take out my frustrations at my own shortcomings on my wife and son by yelling and overreacting to small things like dishes not being done, house not vacuumed, etc. I don\\'t blame her for wanting me gone and not talking to me right now, even though that\\'s all I want to do along with hug my son. I\\'m scared this is the straw that broke the camel\\'s back, and it pains me to think that this horrible version of me is how both of them will see me for the rest of their lives.\\n\\nIt\\'s been 8 days since our falling out started, and 5 days since I\\'ve spoken to either of them at all, she has cut contact currently. Again, I don\\'t blame her for that as I have been a terrible husband and father for a couple years now as the anger has taken over more and more of my life.\\n\\nI have an appointment to see a counselor on Tuesday to start working on my anger management and I\\'m also considering looking into an autism evaluation as I\\'ve noticed some similarities in how my emotional outbursts manifest and given that autism was under diagnosed in the early 90s when I was diagnosed with ADD, I wonder if I\\'ve been trying to treat the wrong thing all this time.\\n\\nNot sure what I hoped to accomplish with this post, but I\\'ve written enough letters and notes to myself to try to process my thoughts over these few days, and as much as I know they want to help, I\\'m still struggling to be fully open about all my feelings with my parents. And it doesn\\'t exactly help that two of their most consistent coping recommendations is to just \"wait and see how this plays out\" and \"she isn\\'t blameless in this either.\" I guess I felt that finally talking about this to a group of strangers would be a good way to start getting more comfortable with opening up about my feelings.\\n\\nThanks for listening.\\n\\nAlso, I\\'m currently reading \"before you split\" by toni nieuwhof, and although I\\'m not religious in any way it\\'s scary how many direct parallels I can draw to my own life. I hope that these waves of emotion I feel when I realize I\\'m doing some of these exact things I\\'m reading in this book are a good sign that maybe I\\'ll actually be able to make some real changes this time.',\n",

I also can’t help but be frustrated that my brother is only a 90 minute drive away at college and isn’t coming home this weekend. Last night he went out to a party. I’m in college too. It may be online, but I am a week behind in my classes because I have been doing everything. I’m supposed to graduate in May and I’m afraid I won’t. My teachers know what’s going on and are understanding, but I don’t want to feel like I’m behind in everything for the whole semester. \\n\\nIf you made it this far, thank you for reading.

       " 'Migrating to a new country made me feel all kinds of anxiety for the first time I wanted to share my experience here so that I can let things off of my chest for you guys to read and hopefully let someone dealing with the same thing that they\\'re not alone. I am also open to any guidance and suggestions.\\n\\nAnyway, I recently migrated to Canada to study at BCIT for two years and possibly work for more. \\nI was excited since I felt like a bum back in my own country. Like, I was 18 but never really felt like an adult. Part time jobs for teenagers wasn\\'t really a thing in my country so I was stuck in my home playing video games all day, eating, sleeping etc. So coming to Canada felt like a good choice because I can grow as a person. I was stepping towards a big obstacle with hardships that if I overcome, will give me the pride to say that \"I am an adult that went through hell! I have pride in my self! Look at me mom and dad, I did it! Im not a loser anymore!\"\\n\\n In the first weeks I felt  like, \"this is it! I\\'m a freshman experiencing college life in a new country!\" But when my father left to go back to our country, that\\'s when things started to go downhill. \\n\\nMy first days in BCIT were ok, I liked the place, the prof was kind, etc. But my school was known for one thing: STRESS. They have excellent quality of education at the cost of you sacrificing your social life lol. I took Trades so the topics were sorta easy but the practical work and the quantity of work was enough for you to be occupied most of the week.\\n\\nWhat I wanted to secure here first were new friends. Turns out talking to your old friends in discord isn\\'t enough to make you feel better. I miss them. So I tried talking to my classmates and befriending them. Heres the problem, they\\'re  significantly older than me, I\\'m 19 and they\\'re around late 20s and mid 30s. Not that they\\'re hard to converse with; We have fun talking sessions during lunch but that\\'s about it. I try to ask them to hang out or treat them to lunch but they kindly decline. So my relationship with them is only being lunch buddies. Maybe I\\'m too pushy? Now I don\\'t consider myself socially awkward but I am shy. Maybe I\\'ll try joining clubs next?\\n\\nI also miss my family, I miss the comfort of my own home, I miss my dog who wakes me up begging for food in the morning... Now, I do live with my relatives, I have cousins here but then again, they\\'re significantly older than me, they\\'re out of the house most of the time so I come back home with no one there. I also live in the basement which is cool and all but it does get lonely from time to time. I did talk about my feelings with them and they understand. One of them also suggested and gave me her therapist\\'s info. They said I was experiencing culture shock since things here are way different back in my country and my body was telling me it\\'s stressed out even though I think Im fine.\\n\\nThings were starting to get worse, lately I think I have \"illness anxiety\" that every weird thing my body does I immediately interpret it as a serious fatal condition. Like my eyelid and leg twitching that probably is a month old was a sign of ALS. 2 days ago, my heart palpitated before sleeping which it never did, gave me a serious panic attack (but is it really a panic attack or a mini heart attack? You see, my paranoia gets me) that lasted the whole night. I woke up and my heart was still racing for the whole day so I called in sick and didn\\'t go to school that day. Till this day, I\\'m anxious all of the time and I still feel my chest burning. I assume it\\'s heartburn so I take antacids which helped it lessen but didn\\'t make it go away. I also exercise every weekends which also temporarily takes away the anxiety and the burning feeling in my chest. But when I relax, anxiety comes back.\\n\\nI called the clinic yesterday for a checkup but they said I cant go since my medical services card was invalid so they told me I have to sort it out with MSP services first that the card they gave me wasn\\'t working... Im still thinking about going to therapy for my anxiety since I am having a hard time finding the best time I can go since have a part-time job that adds to the stress plus my weekend assignments. (It\\'s easy to sort it out I know, just time management. I\\'m just thinking if the 140$/hr sounds like something I can do.)\\n\\nAnyway, here I am:\\nhomesick, \\nAlone,\\nscared if I\\'m going to die, \\nScared to sleep because anxiety worsens at night,\\n\\nI think this is the \"Life\" mom was talking to me about. I\\'m tearing up rn writing this because I am now experiencing her teachings which I usually say, \"ok mom I get it!\" \\nNow for those who might ask, \"do you really want this or were you forced to?\" The thing is, I kinda do. I wanna do this for them. My dad spent his savings for my future and I don\\'t want to waste it (I kid you not international student tuition costs triple more than local students). I wanted to do this for myself too. I want to grow as a person. \"Forged through fire\" perse.\\n\\nI\\'m ok with stress but I hate it when my body does crap that scares me to death. And I hate it that here I am complaining that life is hard when there are much more people that have it WAYY harder than mine. I live in a good house rent-free, I have enough money to sustain myself, My parents support me financially, and here I am complaining/having anxiety. \\n\\nWow, I wrote an essays worth! Hahaha.

       " 'Chronic Stress About Emails TL;DR: I have crippling email anxiety. I hate just the process of logging in to check on things, let along reading new emails. I have 2FA enabled, but that adds a new facet to the anxiety because of hacking fears. I know this is irrational and it’s ruining my state of mind. \\n\\nSo I hate that emails are basically a necessity in modern day life. I don’t even use mine for any serious or financial matters (just my socials), but the fact they exist and could hypothetically be compromised without me knowing just gets to me sometimes? \\n\\nWhich is frustrating because I’m also glad they exist, because they let me have my socials which I enjoy using? \\n\\nI make it a habit to check my email addresses at least a few times a month (any more than that and I get unbelievably paranoid/feel sick to my stomach, something else I want to overcome because I’m pretty sure even most people on here aren’t anxious about LOGGING IN to their emails, just checking them/reading new ones). \\n\\nI’ve been getting the verification codes like normal and only when prompted like they’re supposed to be, but I still think in the back of my head ‘wait what if it’s a hacker?’ \\nEven though if it was, they’d likely send the ‘verification texts’ randomly right? \\n\\nHad an incident just the other day where I got a code from a random number when logging into one of my addresses. I got scared because as far as I could remember it never displayed a number before, just ‘Verify’ or something like that. \\nBacked up and tried it again, same thing. Inputted the code and it worked, so that means it’s official. \\nI did it a third time before just to be safe, same result. I don’t know why it freaked me out, but my anxiety’s probably going to be spiked for a while now. Looking back I think it almost gave me a panic attack (not sure though, just felt like it in hindsight). \\n\\nIt’s incredibly frustrating, bluntly it makes me feel like an over sensitive paranoid idiot. The wonders of anxiety, amirite? \\n\\nI think the reason is I have an overwhelming fear of being hacked. I always have; it’s what stopped me from making any kind of email address for ages (my current two are only a couple years old). Even though this is kind of irrational to begin with, since if anything happened I’d be notified by my 2FA I have set up on both addresses. \\n\\nLike, if anything my accounts are more secure than most because most people don’t think it’s that big a deal if you have 2FA or not, right? \\n\\nAll it would take if someone did try to get in is to log in and change my passwords, it’s not like it would even be that difficult! \\nAnd I’m just an everyday person. There’d be no reason for any would-be hackers to get into my stuff anyway, I don’t have anything worth stealing since I don’t even have any financial stuff linked to either of them! \\n\\nSo yeah I’m in a bad way over this stuff. \\nIt’s not helping me at all, and it’s been damaging my ability to check up on my emails consistently (Also for security reasons, that’s mainly just to ease my mind about the hacking fear thing to be honest). \\nThe incident from the other day has made me doubt checking my other address soon, even though everything was legit (there weren’t even any updates in the security section of my address when I checked either, and I even refreshed repeatedly and still nothing!) \\nEven thinking about it right now is making me feel bad! \\n\\nI’d really appreciate some reassurance I’m not going mad on this.

       " \"Reflecting on Anxiety's impact on my life at age 34 - where it went wrong **Tldr;** anxiety subtlety caused me to dissolve friendships and strive towards a dull, mundane predictable life because it was safe and controllable. This led to severe depression. This led to a breakdown. Relationship broke up, I quit work, had a break, started therapy – now working on acceptance. \\n\\nIt's no exaggeration that my anxiety has influenced my life more than any other factor. I had it as a child, and I also developed a stutter at about age 14, with its potency correlating with my anxiety levels, e.g. the more anxious I am, the more I stutter. This anxiety/stuttering combo has been kicking my ass for the past 20-years. During this time I tried different anxiety medications, speech therapy (for the stutter), traditional therapy and all the usual self-help stuff.. hundreds of books, videos, meditation, mindfulness, nutrition, elimination diets, supplements, nootropics, sleep tests, blood tests etc…\\n\\nI've been doing a lot of reflecting lately, as this year it all came to a climax. Despite all my efforts I never got past it. My anxious tendencies caused me to lose ties with all my friends over the years, I never made the effort to keep these relationships going, and so they all fizzled out beyond repair. I stayed at the job that was sapping my soul because it was comfortable, better the devil you know right? And so, I achieved this mundane, predicable, dull, unstimulating lifestyle which is exactly what anxious me wanted, because it was safe and controllable.\\n\\nThis is when depression came along, and is it any wonder it did. This dull lifestyle combined with covid lockdown brought my depression to really bad levels. It’s also worth noting, one mentality I was trying to train for tackling my anxiety was “not caring about things so much”. You know with books like “How to not give a f\\\\*ck” etc.. I was trying to build on this mindset prior to the depression. However, when the depression came along, I became incredibly nihilistic – indeed I didn’t care about anything, nothing mattered, nothing interested me and I just wanted to be done with life.\\n\\nThe beginning of this year I had a breakdown of sorts; I actually started a new job after a false lull of motivation. I’d get them every now and then, a little surge of belief that this time it’d be different, that my new morning routine was the answer, or how my mentality had finally shifted – but it hadn’t. I started the new job, and our old friend anxiety came back with a vengeance, combined with the depression that absolutely was still there. I became a stuttering, anxious mess that didn’t care about life anymore.\\n\\nOnce suicidal thoughts were becoming more prominent, I quit work without anything lined up and took some time off. Fortunately, I still had the self-awareness to recognise that this was heading into a point of no return. At this time my 8-year relationship also broke down. 2-3 years of being this shell of a human was too much for her, she’d seen numerous “false starts” where “this time it’s different”, she knew it would end up the same.\\n\\nIronically, the few months I took off from working, combined with traditional talking therapy were huge for me. If she had gave it one more chance, maybe it would have been different this time, maybe not… maybe her leaving was needed for true change.\\n\\nNow I find myself here, and I’m trying to make sense of where it all went wrong. Anxiety is a horrible, evil curse. it has subtlety influenced my whole life. It has pushed me away from adventure, friendships and ambition. It turned me into this husk of a person. \\n\\nI think the positive from all this (if there is one), is that I kind of had to go through it all to gain this true understanding. Even if I was back in those situations with this foresight, I wouldn’t have been different as my brain chemistry would still be the same, regardless of what words you feed to it.\\n\\nI wish I had traditional, talking therapy earlier – just talking out your mind to somebody made a massive difference to me, it’s helped me accept and understand it more. Maybe if I had that at an earlier age it would have compounded over the years. I’d certainly advise that to anybody struggling, there is no loss from trying it.\\n\\nI always had a mentality of needing to “fix” this, there must be a “cure” – but that was the true downfall, this naïve pursuit of an impossibility. I believe the true way is acceptance, accepting that this is how you operate, and being kind, patient and loving to yourself regardless. Previously I’d be frustrated, impatient and angry with myself for this “flaw” I have. But if it was a physical impairment you wouldn’t act with such naivety, why then should it be different with a mental impairment? Although ironically, I find that acceptance simmers the anxiety, so in itself, it is a sort of combative against it. But you’ve got to be careful to not start thinking it’s fixed and going back to old ways.\\n\\nI’ve recently gained a lot of interest in Stoicism, less so with a self-help type approach, but more of a framework of how to live and understand myself. I’m also trying to shift to a mentality of gaining experiences, as these are the things that will truly matter on your deathbed. Therapy, stoicism, self-kindness, acceptance and new experiences is my new recipe – I hope it brings more success than before.\\n\\nWow, this was a really long ramble. I’m not sure what I hoped to gain from this, it’s more for my own gain to be honest as I’m trying to understand, but maybe it’ll be useful for somebody too if you read this – thanks for coming!\",\n",

I called out the fact that I seemed to be the only one getting told off for this even though my colleagues weren’t doing it either. \\n\\nMy manager then told me the job I was doing wasn’t good enough. And after feeling on edge all night I took it personally even though it obviously wasn’t. So I cried and had to sit outside for a few minutes.

I immediately regretted speaking it into existence because I didn’t want to jinx it.\\n\\nAt the start of this week, my mother had a phone call off of my 90+ grandmother to say that there’s been drama in the family. She needs someone to stay in her house with her, or go up there. Every single day my mother has gone up, and every single day when she got home and before, I’d ask her again and again “is she okay?” \\n\\nYesterday, I called my grandmother as my mother was outside and she didn’t sound as perky as usual.

       " 'I finally found the root cause of two of my biggest anxiety factors, but now I don\\'t know what to do next! For many, many years now, two things make me really anxious. Like cripplingly anxious, to the point where I feel physically incapaciated at times, often wrapping myself in a blanket, pillow over my head and then trying to wait till the attack passed, or sometimes holding back tears and the scared voices in my head telling me horrible stories.\\n\\nThe first one is the doorbell. The sound of my doorbell ringing gave me panic attacks to the point where I would sometimes sit by the door with the door open just hoping that when someone would come, the bell wouldn\\'t have to ring. I always associated a doorbell with impending doom and would end up almost paralysed physically by fear. So much so that when I moved back home for a couple of months to be with my parents, I begged to have the doorbell changed to a tone that did not strike terror in my heart.\\n\\nThe second one is people talking in the background. It could be the adjacent apartment, it could be the next room or just two people talking about their day in the background. The very fact that I can hear their voices (even though I might not be able to figure out what they are saying) is enough to make the hair on my neck stand on end and trigger intense fear and anxiety, shallow breathing and a deep sense of dread. \\n\\nBoth these trigger me to the point of feeling physcially sick, incapacitated and like mental train wreck. I fight back tears and often have my work performance affected by the second trigger (people talking in the background)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI finally found the reasons why.\\n\\nDuring my final year of college I lived in a small apartment rented out by a cranky old lady. This lady lived in perpetual fear of being evicted from her own home by her other tenants and of getting scammed out of her money.\\n\\nThis said cranky lady would ring the doorbell at 6:00AM sharp on the 1st of every month and demand the rent and threaten to evict me. I would literally dread this and eventually had to beg my father back home to send me my monthly allowance a day early so I could pay her the evening before the 1st of the month and have some peace.\\n\\nThis \"fear of being evicted\"  is what is triggered by the doorbell. It brings back those dark days (I was not in a good place mentally at that time ) and those painful memories.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs a kid and through my teens, my parents would constantly be arguing and fighting. We lived in a large family and the other members would be constantly fighting with each other as well. I, being the kid was banished out of sight while these arguments went on. Often I would hear raised voices and would assume (childishly) that they were talking about me. I often feared that my parents would divorce and I would be abandoned. Thankfully none of that happened but the childhood memories remain.\\n\\nThe \"fear of being abandoned\" and \"what are they talking about, is it about me?\" is what is triggered by other people talking in the background.\\n\\nMy people pleasing tendencies came from this. If only I could stop them arguing, I would be so happy. If they were happy they would stop arguing and so I needed to please them every time.\\n\\nIt took years of struggling to finally come up with the reason why, but now I am at a loss as to how to deal with this anxiety. I often plug in headphones to drown out the sound of people talking, and the doorbell doesn\\'t give me as much anxiety as it used to but now I am clueless as to how to repair this. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nCan anyone advise?',\n",

For background information I have been diagnosed with ADHD (Twice), OCD, Major Depressive Disorder (Twice), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (4 times)\\n\\n I have an obnoxiously specific night routine that I usually follow. The best way I can describe it is that I am, first, confronted with the idea of going to bed (while incredibly sleepy), get anxious, then distract myself with video games. Then, I reach an \"oh shit\" point (after looking at the clock), spurring me to my bed. During this build up to the \"oh shit moment\", I take Kratom from 6-10 as a means of self  treating myself for the regular (every) day anxiety I experience, just so I can enjoy some games with friends. After we get offline and I retreat back into my tomb, my routine has been taking Kava at 10:30 until 1:00 AM. I then have a cocktail (measured for 1 standard drink) and start getting ready to bed. \\n\\nDuring this whole process, I am checking in with myself, \"still anxious?\". Because I know the feeling of not being anxious. I know the feeling of sitting in the middle of a field under a large tree, while the wind blows ever so gently. I know the feeling of arriving to a place so familiar that any weight you have been carrying slumps to the floor and you can finally be you. I know the feeling of watching snowfall out the window while you are curled up with a new mystery book in front of the fire, your cat purring on your lap blissfully at peace. \\n\\nI do not feel that way. \\n\\nI have felt that way before, but that is not how I feel before bed.\\n\\nSo, after the cocktail, I go back up to my room and take Zaleplon (cue interactions comments). My thought process is that if I take the Z 30 minutes before getting into bed, I will be able to make food (which I feel like I have to eat to sleep, it\\'s weird) and ice cream, which will give me just enough time to turn on a show and smoke a Delta-8 pen. Most nights I actually play on a handheld gaming device as well, just for some low level stimulation. I also bring another 1 serving drink or just Kava up to bed, in case I wake up in the middle of the night. \\n\\nAfter eating the ice cream and watching the show, I turn over and hit the brix. However, sometimes I worry like \"oh did I forget this\" and \"oh I took enough of that right?\", even to the point where I was just falling asleep, realized I had not eaten ice cream that night, jumped out bed and went downstairs and ate ice cream just to satisfy that anxious part of my brain. \\n\\nAnd, inevitably, I wake up pretty groggy, which leads me to maybe take naps during the day or sleeping in, which leads to the \"oh shit\" moment and the hamster wheel keeps spinning.\\n\\nI know this is a long post, but where do I even start?',\n",

The test came back fine and they did another round of blood work for possible clotting which came back fine. \\n\\nThe NP didn’t know how else to help me until I see my PCP again on 10/4, so she offered me Ativan in the clinic and a small prescription. The script is for .5mg once or twice a day for three days as needed. \\n\\nI took a .5 mg tablet there and It made me feel… gross. Spacey. I don’t like not being alert- but it finally made the racing thoughts in my head stop and slow down. Maybe it didn’t completely take the anxiety away, but I was calm. My high blood pressure and heart rate from the beginning of the checkup improved significantly after taking it. I’ve never taken a sedative before and of course I read up on side effects, withdrawals… it makes me scared to use my prescription. I don’t want to somehow experience withdrawal but my anxiety is convincing me that if I take it again something bad will happen. I don’t want to feel worse than I already do. But I also don’t want to have to go through another extreme panic attack like I had at the clinic- I thought I was going to die. I know it’s a small script and just meant to help me while we look for a good option for treatment, but you know, anxiety.\\n\\nTLDR; I have always had anxiety regarding new medication. I got prescribed a small amount of Ativan to curb my constant anxiety for a little bit but I’m afraid of misusing it.\\n\\nThose of you who have experience with this medication, do you have any advice for me?',\n",

       " 'No matter how hard I try I\\'ll never be good enough I\\'ve been pursuing my dream career for 5 years now. The field is extremely competitive, due to there not being enough supply of internships, which is necessary to become certified, to meet demand. Covid has made things even harder, but it was already insane before that.\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'ve completed 2 hands-on educational experiences (they\\'re called practicums which are more or less \"mini internships\") and done over 1400 volunteer hours total in pursuit of this internship. \\nEven all that experience isn\\'t enough and several of the internships I\\'ve applied for didn\\'t have me move forward to the interview phase. Miraculously, on this 5th or 6th (I\\'ve lost count at this point) time I\\'ve applied for internships, I actually did move into the interview phase with 3 different internship sites. This is so important to me but also incredibly anxiety-inducing because of how high the stakes are. Admittedly the first two interviews I know could\\'ve gone better, and while I haven\\'t officially heard back from either of them yet, those interviews were about two weeks ago and were just preliminary so I\\'m fairly confident that if I haven\\'t heard back from them yet that the chances of getting an official interview are slim.\\n\\nI had a 3rd interview on Tuesday and while I know I could\\'ve done a bit better, I actually felt somewhat confident about the job I did since the anxiety didn\\'t totally get to me. I felt like this was my most promising lead and I was excited at the hope that this would be the moment......you can see where this is going.\\n\\nI got an email from them yesterday saying that I\\'m on the  \"wait-list\" for their second round of interviews, so I seriously doubt that it\\'s gonna happen. There are still two internships I applied to that I haven\\'t heard anything from since the applications were due, but again, if I haven\\'t heard anything by this point (the official Offer Day for these internships is Oct 12th) then I doubt it\\'s going to happen.\\n\\nI try so hard and I\\'m so passionate about the field, more than anyone I\\'ve met imho, and yet it doesn\\'t matter because I\\'m a crappy interviewer and no one will give me a chance. There\\'s no other way to become certified in the field, I have to get an internship. There\\'s nothing else that I can see myself doing, career-wise, but its devastating that I can\\'t get past this step.

Wondering why I’m so afraid of people being mean to me that it causes me to constantly think and worry about it. I’m always assuming the worst of people and judging myself to the harshest degree. \\n\\nWhy I am this way is not a hard question to answer. I’ve been this way my entire life. I’ve always had this fear inside of me, as I’ve grown and matured my fears have changed but it’s still always there, just fear and anxiety. \\n\\nSome of my earliest memories are of my mother telling me not to go outside because it’s dangerous. She projected her anxieties onto me since I was very small throughout my whole life. She taught me that the world was a horrible and scary place filled with people who wanted to kidnap me and torture me and kill me. She would tell me stories about other young girls my age who were kidnapped and murdered and she showed me their pictures and told me they were just like me. I had a very warped view of the world that it was this terrible terrifying place. I was so scared to go “outside” by myself/without an adult (even my front yard) until I was in high school. \\n\\nThe irony of it all is my mother was so anxious of these strangers doing horrible things to me, meanwhile under her own roof I was being abused by a family member. But where was her extreme reaction when she found this out? It was nowhere to be found. Swept under the rug pretend it never happened. That’s a whole other story. \\n\\nMy childhood had good moments but it also had fear. So much fear and anxiety. I was scared of strangers, the dark, being alone, of UFO’s, aliens, being kidnapped, death, the list goes on and on. Did other children spend this much time ruminating in fear? Constant state of cortisol and fight or flight? \\n\\nI was not setup for success in any way shape or form by my parents or my upbringing. I survived and coped how I could and I carry the weight of a difficult and anxious life on my shoulders. \\n\\nI’m just so tired of feeling this way. I don’t want to be scared anymore. I’ve wasted so much energy in my life being scared for nothing, and to this day I still am, it’s just attaching itself on different things.\\n\\nI’m just venting. I know I’ll feel better.

       " 'The relation between mental and physical health I am all out of whack lately. Every year in august, like clockwork, my health anxiety and physical health ailments spike and last for 2-3 months. Still in the thick of it right now. \\n\\nLast august I had a terrible case of hives (never experienced that before), the week after returning to work from an extended time off, which was also coincidentally the same week my entire household got head lice. I was so stressed out with everything, my anxiety was going through the roof. It’s no surprise I ended up covered in red, itchy blotches \\n\\nThis year, health issues appeared in august again. I have been eating terribly lately. Mainly because I’m so stressed and anxious, which automatically makes my appetite disappear. I’ve been living off of about 500 food calories a day for weeks, and usually all I have for dinner is alcohol. Shameful, I know. No wonder I woke up in the middle of the night with the worst abdominal pain I could ever imagine. 7 hours later it hadn’t subsided so I went to the ER. I was diagnosed with colitis and told to eat small, frequent, bland foods. Haven’t done as well as I should following that plan. I was supposed to go see a gastro dr, but living in FL means my appt was cancelled due to the hurricane and i have to wait 2 months for the next opening. \\n\\nNext up in my not so fun health adventures is some mysterious itchy skin condition plaguing my partner and I. He had it first and apparently transmitted it to me. None of the doctors can figure out what it is, and meds don’t help. I’m up all night scratching my skin. I also have some issues going on in the nether regions, so I spend my free time scrolling Dr. google trying to figure out if it’s herpes, uti, or a yeast infection. I know my partner has been unfaithful lately, so really my diagnosis is anybodys guess. \\n\\nWent for blood work this morning for the first time in 3 years and passed out in the chair. This is the second time I’ve passed out while getting labs drawn. They offered to call me an ambulance, but who can pay that bill? I’ll just drive myself home and hope for the best. \\n\\nI know how strong the relation is between mental and physical health, but i feel just stuck in a trap right now. My mental health is bad, which causes poor appetite/sleeping, which causes health problems, which exacerbates my health anxiety, and the merry go round just keeps on going. \\n\\nI am 33 years old and have been dealing with this since my late teens. Therapy doesn’t help. Meds don’t help. I am at my wits end.',\n",

I didn’t know what it was, just felt like something bad was gonna happen. i’ve always been a worst case scenario thinker so this was usually normal, but today it felt so different. It lingered with me throughout the day. I was just thinking it was nothing, but it didn’t feel like any other day, this fear felt so different. At around 2-3 it started taking over my day. I just felt something so off. I decided to just keep moving on with my day. My sisters came over to my house, and as I went out and saw them I got the fear again. It was a feeling of impending doom for my sister. Again, so different than a regular fear. I tried to shrug it off, thinking it was my anxiety. They end up leaving, hours go on. And about 30 minutes ago I get a call from my mom, before I even answered I knew. I knew something happened. She told me my sister got hit by a car, I was in shock. They just rushed her to the hospital. I can’t go to the hospital because the rest of my family was already gone from the house before this happened and I can’t drive yet. Now i’m stuck here. I’m really freaked out and scared. She’s talking and all though.But I feel like I had an obligation to say something to prevent all of this. I don’t know how I could’ve, but I feel like I should’ve done something. I knew that this fear felt so different, but I didn’t do anything. Now I feel so bad.

       " \"Dogs are seriously affecting my mental health We have 2 dogs.  I've grown to love them but NEVER wanted pets.  I don't like pets and didn't want the responsibility.  My son and husband wanted a dog.  After many months of them begging, I reluctantly agreed to one dog under the condition that THEY would take care of it (scooping poop, playing, walking, etc.).  We got the dog.  He was (and still is) very energetic and had a couple of destructive episodes.  A friend suggested we get a second dog because he was probably bored/lonely.  I was desperate and debated rehoming him.  We got the second dog from a shelter.  He was quite the opposite of the first dog.  Very mild mannered. \\n\\nSo, 3.5 years later, here we are with two dogs (1st dog is ~3.5 years old and 2nd dog is a little over 5 years old).  I'm completely miserable.  My son is busy with sports.  My husband works a rotating shift that involves weekends.  I feel like I'm always stuck caring for the dogs between their schedules.  In fact, I feel like I was tasked with this chore early on.  I work from home several days a week.  Some days I'll kennel them while I'm working and give potty breaks every couple of hours.  Other days I'll work downstairs and leave them out while I'm working.  Either scenario is stressful for me because I have a demanding job.  Attention to detail is required.  I don't have time to watch thr clock.  It's a huge distraction. The younger dog is very active and always wants to play.  If I don't he will whine and nudge me with his nose.  I'm constantly telling him to stop, sit, etc.  I will play with them but it never seems to be enough.  The younger dog tends to gravitate towards me and can be clingy at times.\\n\\nOther issues: no flexibility and no freedom.  They're people aggressive so we can't have people in our home unless they are kenneled or gated off in a separate area.  It's such a hassle to have people over that I just don't anymore.  Not even my sons friends.  We can't just decide to stop at a restaurant after practice because we have to get home to feed the dogs or let them out.  If we go to someone's house we have to plan it around the dogs' bedtime or come home, feed them, and then go back (we're usually in the vicinity).  We can't travel without spending an arm and leg to board them.  We have a dedicated pet sitter who comes to our house, but her availability has been super slim since the pandemic.\\n\\nI am absolutely burned out with this situation.  I'm resentful that they even asked for a dog to begin with.  As my son has gotten older he is preoccupied with other things, and I have to make him spend time with the dogs. They're 65-70 lb. dogs and I don't trust my son to walk them.  My husband rarely, if ever, walks them and when he does it's down the block and back.  I go through phases where I walk them regularly  and phases where I don't walk them.  We give them plenty of attention.  Probably too much to be honest.  I feel like I have two toddlers on my hands.  It feels like a babysitting gig that will never end.  I want to look at rehoming them.  My son and husband are furious that I would suggest that.  It isn't my preferred choice but I simply don't want the responsibility and never did.  I want my time to be ny time.  I miss my alone time at home while everyone's away.  I miss being able to make plans on the spur of the moment.  I want my life back. Help!  I can't be the only weirdo going through this.\",\n",

       " 'Struggling with friends and anxiety in 2nd year Sorry this is going to be a long post. \\nI have just started second year and I am still really struggling with friendships. \\n\\nDuring first year, I became friends with 2 of my flatmates and during sem 1 it was great. However in sem 2 I began to notice that they seemed closer to eachother than either of them were to me. I could see the duo in the trio. This kindof sparked a lot of self doubt and I began questioning all of my uni friends and before I knew it I felt so insecure in my friendships. \\n\\nSome of these fears confirmed themselves. An example is during sem 2 I was sat in a pres with one of my flatmates and a girl from my course and the flatmate asked ‘say it or shot it, who did u like the least out of our group at first’ and my course mate said me💀. Ik it might sound a little silly but it rlly effected me, especially since I’d never say that ab anyone. Since then I’ve just felt so out of place, it rlly confirmed my fear. A couple similar things have happened where ppl have said small bitchy things or jokes that just make me feel so out of place. I’ve tried to confide in other uni friends about this and I just got brushed off, being told that I took it to heart unnecessarily. Which idk I don’t think I did. It really hurt my feelings. \\n\\n I literally can’t act like myself around people. I feel like an outsider in my own body trying to fit in with these people and I feel like they can all see right through me. My anxiety has returned about 10x worse. I can’t have one conversation without worrying that these people all secretly don’t like me. I find myself stressing about this but then I sort of realise that I would never be friends with some of the girls in the house outside of uni. I know my anxiety is not normally this bad bc I’m fine when I’m at home and with my home friends. \\nNow I’m living in a house with all these girls bc we signed it before any of this happened.\\n\\nThe girl who is the one I face the most issue with (the one who made the least liked comment at pre drinks) constantly makes me look stupid in conversatio. Just constantly trying to make me look small or correct me over little things. \\n\\nI really wish I could just not care but now I’m in the house with these girls I feel so much pressure to be funny, to be likeable. But I just can’t, everytime I’m with them I feel so out of place.

The RSD makes you very vulnerable to judgment, essentially.  \\nI have perfectionism and people-pleasing tendencies, mostly in my relationship and how my partner perceives me, even though we have been together for years now.\\n\\nThe situation: my ruminative symptoms of OCD have been heavily present this past year (the year of my wedding and honeymoon).  I can pretty much deduce that my OCD has latched on tighter than usual because of the pressure that can come along with these events.\\n\\nThe thing is, I have started to notice a pattern that I couldn't quite make out before now.  When I quietly go through perfectionism/people-pleasing themes and get through the episode myself, in my head, without it disrupting others, I tend to keep things under control if not just bearable enough to get by and eventually move on to something else.  However, what I've noticed is that when I am called out by my partner - for something that maybe I didn't do quite right, or something that I could have done differently - I am very acutely triggered.  \\n\\nThis is where the RSD and Real Event rumination link up here... For example, if my partner even slightly raises their voice at me, my 'inner child' or 'ego' or whetever you want to call it feels so attacked.  I instantly enter this almost parallel-universe-like state, where I immediately feel in danger and wish that I could go back in time 2 minutes to correct the situation so that I can't risk disappointing or making my partner upset, even if this 'upset' is objectively minimal.  \\n\\nWhen I get into these states, I can actually sense that the precise moment is going to become an episode of Real Event OCD, where I will constantly go back in time in my head to try and imagine how things could have panned out had I just managed to do everything right.\\n\\nFrom what I gather about research online is that Real Event OCD tends to be about things from years past that pop up and 'haunt' you.  \\n\\nMy Real Event OCD seems to be triggered by things that happen from my Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria, and the events begin haunting me within just minutes of it happening - and then I keep thinking about it and feeling guilty about the event for days, weeks, months, engaging in the compulsion of rumination to try and ease the feelings of discomfort.  I enter a shame spiral and my brain blames the exact moment of RSD for my negative/depressive state and I can't just let go and accept that things happened the way they did, almost like a part of me doesn't think I deserve to get over it.\\n\\nHas anyone every experienced this kind of mix of RSD and Real Event OCD?\\n\\nThanks everyone,\",\n",

I am having to more work than in my entire life in order to stay caught  up. I have started taking anxiety medication and sleep medication because I  am having a hard time dealing with everything. I can’t sleep or even focus on the tv. It’s the constant worrying about work, working, and trying to sleep, but can’t from worry about things to come. I have  graves disease and it’s gone out of control. I have been told to seek the help of psychiatrist. Part of me wants to stay at my job, but another part wants runs for hills. I’m been thinking of asking for an assistant job instead and just dealing with my anxiety. I have also lost a bunch of weight from not being able to eat - I am down to 97lbs. I’m bad to get to doing som and forgetting to eat. I haven’t taken care of my self or the house since school started. I know I have had several  panic attacks just thinking about work. My husband says to try to go back to support. I’m trying to hold out until I can see a psychiatrist. My doctor  has recommended medical leave.   \\n\\n\\napparently I functioned better as assistant because I could turn my brain off of work once I left. Now I have no boundaries and it sucks.',\n",

At 15 I had my first panic attack, when I asked to go see a psychologist I was screamed at by my father and was not allowed to go. I started coping any way I could. Fast forward 20 years, I had a traumatic triggering even happen in my life and I started spiraling. I got arrested for something stupid but the judge actually found me not guilty and wiped my record. I was in therapy, group therapy and was on medication. Everything seemed to be going well and I was on the up swing. One day HR calls me into their office. They wanted to ask me about a letter they received regarding me going to prison for embezzlement. I explained I was never in prison for anything let alone embezzlement! They talked to the financial controller and he cleared my name. I thought I was weird so I ran a background check on myself and it was clean. It caused a massive anxiety response in me and sent me into depression. An anonymous person who is actively trying to get me fired? My therapist helped me work through it. After about a year and a half my therapist discharged me and I was feeling great. Then about 3 years later, covid hit. The lockdowns, the fighting, the disease itself. If I left my house once a week I was doing good. Eventually we started going back to the office and that’s when the office fighting about the vaccine began. I stayed out of it but it was hard not to hear everything going on. I saw people that were friends for many years get into screaming arguments and stop talking to one another. Eventually the vaccine became less of a hit button issue. The world was slowly starting to get back to normal but my anxiety was not subsiding.\\nI started therapy again. This time my therapists goal was to find specific trauma that could be triggering me. We have been working together for 8 months and I was making good progress…until 2 weeks ago. More letters being sent, this time referring to my arrest from 6 years earlier. My employer got it, branch offices got it and my family got it. When I told HR someone was harassing me their response was keep your private life to yourself, we can’t have someone as public as you with all these accusations going around, it’s not good for business. I was never super close to my family and they seem to be taking the letter as gospel and treating me differently. So now I am paralyzed with fear, my therapist has been checking in with me, we have been trying different coping methods as well as talk therapy. I was recently put back on medication.\\nI feel like I saw a bomb drop and my entire body is bracing until it impacts. That tense ,winced feeling won’t go away. I am now becoming paranoid, I was checking my car for AirTags and trackers, I feel like people in stores are looking at me and following me. This is the worst anxiety and fear I have ever felt in my life. It feels like at any moment I am going to lose everything I have worked so hard for in my life.',\n",

       " 'I’m having Anxiety (unintentionally) because of my friend. So, Im a freshman as high school, and things have been fine, however I got barely any classes with my friends and I think its starting to take a mental toll on me and causing me a lot of anxiety. Im a pretty social, might even say popular, kid in my grade, sure nobody hordes around me and thinks im amazing, but nobody hates me, so I think thats a win. But there’s 1 kid who i’ll call J, who has never liked me (as far back as 7th grade) and constantly gets on my nerves, and this is where my friend comes in, \\n\\nMy friends mom is really close to J’s mom, causing my friend to naturally have to talk with J quite a bit, and thats where the anxiety is, i’ve started getting scared that I’ll be replaced and that people will see me in a bad light for not liking J, im not a monster I can tell J has gotten better than he used to be but I still hold a grudge against him. \\n\\nNow this friend is my best friend, I couldn’t imagine a world without her, so that just makes my anxiety 10x worse because if my anxiety came true then that’d feel like the end of the world to me. I’ve told them about whats going on and they have reassured me on multiple occasions that what im thinking will never come true because of how much I mean to them, and I know they arent lying, we are really close, but that doesnt stop my anxiety from still telling me it could happen, and its been driving me insane. I’ve been so clingy and so insistent on being with my friend 24/7 that it causes me more anxiety because im scared im going to scare them off, even though they know what im going through and are completely fine with it.\\n\\nI dont know what to do, I live in the south where there a very prominent “boys do not cry” mentality and it causes me more anxiety because I cant easily just go to a therapist or seek help because that requires me to go through my mom who, while she doesnt rly care, ik other people do and I have so much social anxiety I dont even want to go to my mom. So i’ve been trying to cope with online methods but they wont work, the only time I feel fine is when Im with my friend.\\nI’d really like a hug right now, words don’t mean anything to my anxiety but actions do.

I have copied the text below because I think it will help with situations of panic for myself and hopefully you as well. The comment is actually about ocean ships going through very frightening storms but the response can be altered to fit whatever anxiety triggers we have.\\n\\nRef: https://www.reddit.com/r/thalassophobia/comments/xql57x/this_may_be_a_repost_but_i_think_we_should_watch/iqclffc?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3\\n\\n&gt;We are taught visualisation techniques, deep breathing, pragmatism and debriefing from acute stress, in that order. \\n\\n&gt;Visualisation is used to help us imagine the science of the waves, the storm, the buoyancy of the vessel, our relative state of control in being able to be with the best people to do the job. We literally imagine our vessel tracking through the storm, and the science of it, which is comforting to us who understand it and know that statistically we are likely to succeed and survive.\\n\\n&gt;Deep breathing is used to control heart rate, nausea and the physical manifestations of acute stress, so as to avoid panic. We practice square breathing - imagine a square and breathe into each corner. We also imagine oxygen being exchanged in different parts of our body, especially our kidneys and adrenal glands, reducing acute stress and panic. We congratulate ourselves for delivering the oxygen and breathing. In really really bad situations, you’ll talk to each other ‘bottom left’ breathe, ‘top left’ breathe - ‘how good are those adrenal glands Dave?’ It works well.\\n\\n&gt;Pragmatism is the acceptance that you could die. That you knew this when you got on the boat. That you have achieved and experienced something few have ever been able to. That you made your peace with your loved ones and got your affairs in order before you left. That if the storm takes you, your death will come quickly and is unlikely to hurt for long. That you are a small part of a wonderful ocean. For the religious, God is watching you and protecting your path to your afterlife. You won’t have to fight, you can relax and know that soon there is no pain. Incredibly, accepting your fate is extremely calming, though it sounds macabre and terrifying to people not in a stressful scary situation at the time! \\n\\n&gt;Debriefing from acute stress occurs in the aftermath. You openly talk about your experience with your colleagues. You celebrate that you got through it, but explore the parts that made you most afraid. You talk about the parts you did well, and the parts you might need help with next time. No stone left unturned. Going though every gory detail is liberating - very few people suffer nightmares or panic attacks afterward, and PTSD is almost unheard of. This debriefing also encourages a culture of sharing once on base, so that people don’t hide their stress and have it build up. People openly share that they had a nightmare, talk about it, and we give them what they need to deal and heal. That’s how we ensure everyone can cope with the return trip, and willingly stays on the vessel for two weeks once we get back into home port, for quarantine and home trip debrief. So we aren’t a mess returning to our families!\\n\\n&gt;I will admit that yes, I’m not phased by most things now. I also find it very difficult to suffer acute physical pain in the same way as others (good old circle breathing!). I’m a 40 year old woman who has now had cancer twice. I’m allergic to many types of pain relief and have had a number of surgeries with acetimorphen only, post operatively. I have coped, despite the pain, because I imagine the success of my body recovering and the science of my trajectory.

For context, I am recovering from anxiety and depression but I still rarely leave the house, and have made it my goal to work from home at least until I can cope a bit better. Because of this, I am now technically self employed and have a small business which isn't very successful but it provides decent pocket money. I guess some see this as a success, as I have been invited to speak at an event about my experience building the business specifically as a member of a minority group. The audience will be my peers, people who are likely aspiring to achieve success in the same field or similar, or already have their own businesses. The talk will be on a panel as part of a networking event.\\n\\nAs someone who barely goes out or speaks to people unless I have to, the thought of giving a presentation already makes me want to poop my pants. However, this could be a great boost to my business and, if I wasn't a nervous wreck, could be a good networking opportunity. I realise that in my field, and in many others, networking is the main way to build business so it seems wasteful to let this opportunity go. But I also don't think it will reflect well on me as a professional if I end up crying on a stage in front of my peers. I am so anxious about the stigma and judgement of not only not doing a good job of the presentation, but also exposing how mentally unwell I am.\\n\\nAlso, my concern is that although I might have some things of worth to say, it feels fake to suggest that I am doing anything other than try to survive each day and then work on my business when I have the energy and motivation to do so. Maybe it's imposter syndrome, or a lack of confidence, but I don't see myself as doing 'well' and if I am honest about that I will definitely be crying on a stage. \\n\\nOn the other hand, it is important to have representation for people at all stages of mental health recovery in professional spaces because that is the reality of it. It could be helpful to others who have struggled like I have, and need to see that it is possible to scrape your way out of the deepest dark hole to actually end up liking some parts of your life, even if everything else seems crap. I know how important it can be to hear stories like that.\\n\\nWhat would you do in my situation? How do you cope with having to put yourself out there for work?

I am a 27 years old healthy male but my life is taking a fall for a long time.\\n\\nAs a child I suffered from physical and emotional abuse which caused by both of my parents. My father did beat me all the time and he would continue to insults throughout the day after day. Growing up was hard and happened to be in higly unpredictable environment. Just a regular middle class family with  educated parents, it would be seen as from the outside. Tho it was very different for me.  I fought back everytime I had the chance but what would you expect from a 6 year old when only two people who he can count on in this world were treating him badly. My mother didnt beat me or insult me but she didn't cover me against my father either. \\n\\nYesterday I cried when I remembered a certain memory from that period. Just because I wasn't behaving normally according to him and playing in my room with my toys. He had beaten me up and left the room. I knew it wasnt over because that was his thing, he would come back later on and continue beating me, so I was just waiting in my room and preparing for the next physical assault. He showed up with an hammer and two nails. Threw them on my desk and said '' If you get me annoyed again I would use those nail to hang you to that wall from your ears.'' And he left them there so I can remember his threat everytime I sit on my desk.\\n\\nThis kinda shit happened all the time. I was literally walking on my toes at the house so he won't hear me and beat me because I walk in a certain way or Idk maybe I drank water from a clean glass instead of cleaning the dirty one and using it. He has beaten me outdoors, in front of my friends and he would take me to barber shop and got me a almost no hair-haircut. I wasn't allowed to grow hair until I was 14 years old. What really destroys me is I still remember how I felt when I was standing in my room and waiting in horror seconds before he brings his belt to beat me until I had no tears left in my eyes.\\n\\nPeople only loved me because I was drinking and smoking before everybody else did. Hanging out. Doing drugs. People thought I was the cool guy but I know that now I was the one who was a loser. I never showed emotion to anyone except to a girl that I met in highschool. After 10 years I still do love her. But she abused me emotionally even tho I was having great sex and feeling satisfied being in a relationship with her, she made me lose my mind. At those times I was having flashbacks of my childhood so it got to a point that I tried to kill my father with a kitchen knife but I ended up crying after couple of minutes of attacking and him trying to calm me down. When I told my parents why I did it and how they treated me during my childhood, they denied and said ''Those are not true. Those days are gone and you are not remembering correctly. We did our best etc.''I tried to commit suicide after breaking up with her but I couldn't because my scarf snapped half way through and it was rather extremely painful. I moved on. Finished college, got myself a job. Everything seems to be fine but partially.\\n\\nI am hypervigilant, paranoid, emotionally withdrawn, socially and personally anxious,depressed. My hands are shaking all the time. I am agressive. Looking for threats, starting fight with strangers tho I am really tired of it because I realized even by  someone looking at me couple of seconds long, I got extremely agressive and having a desire to override communication, cursing phases etc and dive into killing mode with a gun or a pointy object. But I understand that it is not worth to go to prison so I am not talking to anyone and avoid conflict.\\n\\nOnsettings of my childhood traumas and trust issues that emerged from toxic relationship with couple of girls. I don't trust anyone, I am looking for contradictions in their stories, trying to prevent any potential emotional damage. Most of the time damage like that slightly happens and  I go neutral mode. I don't feel shit. When people do give gifts or do things for me without any ulterior motive, I get confused and don't know how to react.\\n\\n I avoided those memories long enough that they came back to haunt me even stronger. I don't know what to do. I suffered and I am suffering now.  All I have is my work and I feel I have lost in every other rat race. I can't even talk to the cashier without having to evaluate if that person is a threat just because of our small talk, if she/he felt insulted and will come back and cause me trouble. I sometimes sleep with a knife. I think about events that likely happen in future and trying to find solutions. Sometimes I fall into a void and daydream for the most part. I can't be present. I can't enjoy a goddamn thing without realizing I am not actually fine and feeling good is not my thing. This self desructive.

       " 'Having a bad night :-( Up until this point I would say I was having a relatively good or at least okay day. But once those intrusive thoughts hit it’s like I can’t be okay until I prove they’re not true. I have this recurring thought that something happened to my boyfriend (we’re long distance) and I will text him just to see if he read it (in my mind this is like confirmation that he’s totally fine and it was just a random thought). Sometimes I’ll send videos of my dogs or a photo or something. I sent him a text like three hours ago and didn’t think about it until just now when I went to text him again and realized he never saw it. I didn’t panic right away. I texted again to see if he just missed the notification. He is usually the type to respond right away unless he’s out with friends or something. When I spoke to him last, around 6 or so he didn’t mention any plans for the rest of the day. I tried calling him to see if maybe he just didn’t see my messages. And then when that didn’t work I called again. I know I sound absolutely clingy but I promise it’s not just me wanting his attention. It’s literally just to check if he is okay and as soon as I get that confirmation I can move on. I threw out my Hail Mary which is messaging him on discord (sometimes he plays games and doesn’t check his phone but usually he will see my discord message really fast since it’s right there on screen).

       " 'Medication Recs After Remeron, Lexapro &amp; Zoloft I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety, depression and PTSD in August 2020. I also binge eat at times, especially when depressed or when I don’t get out of bed for days at a time with depression. As a result, I struggle with weight because of the binge eating, but also because when I’m depressed or come off of days with a lot of activity and chaos around me, I crash and can’t leave my bed for days. It’s almost like I need to recharge in the silence. I had mild depression and anxiety my entire life, but didn’t know that’s where my lack of motivation, sensitivity to noise and chaos, and even days spent in bed came from. I could excuse it for other reason. \\n\\nIn 2020, I was hospitalized as the anxiety and depression got so bad, that I couldn’t leave my bed for week at a time and it was the first time I started to have suicidal thoughts. The hospital started me on remeron (mirtazapine). It did not approve any of my symptoms and made me a ZOMBIE even when taken before bed. My brain was so slow I couldn’t even formulate words and I felt it was dangerous to drive. It also made me eat and sleep more and just be even lazier. I stayed on that for 3 months. Then, I was put on lexapro. I started at 10 mg and eventually went to 20 mg over about 6 months. During that 6 months time frame I truly felt like I was starting to LIVE my life for the first time in my entire life! I couldn’t believe that’s what normal people felt like, actually wanting to do stuff and participate in life. I worked out everyday, lost weight, my binge eating, depression and anxiety all got better. Lexapro made me tired so I took it before bed which resolved the fatigue caused by it. The only issue was I was having breakthrough depression for the week before my period and was ultimately diagnosed with PMDD as well. the 7-10 days before my period were so bad I would be in bed, very emotional, frustrated easily, did not work out and binge eating would start up. My doctor suggested moving up to 25 mg, which didn’t help. Then 30 mg, and it made me feel like a zombie. I stuck on it for 3 months but it wasn’t helping with PMDD and honestly i felt like throughout the rest of the month all of my other symptoms were coming back and I was back to square one. It was deeply upsetting because I had felt such hope and then was back to hopelessness. \\n\\nIn april, my doctor switched me to zoloft. Started at 50 mg and over 6 weeks moved to 150 mg, which I take at night and have been on since end of may/beginning of June. Zoloft makes me like a total zombie even if taken at night, and it has since I started w 50 mg. I take at night, get a full night sleep and feel like my head is in the clouds all day. I take adderall for ADHD and any little “boost” that use to give me in the day and concentration or motivation is completely mitigated by the zoloft. I swear my adderall has stoped working since i started the zoloft. I have ZERO motivation to do anything, have gained a lot of weight from binge eating andthe drug as I am constantly hungry and craving sugar, which I never do, and basically the zoloft is only\\nhelpful because it makes me so sedated that I wouldn’t even have the energy to hurt myself. I am feeling very hopeless! I felt such hope with the lexapro when it started working and tasted what it was like to enjoy life. Now I’m at the bottom and don’t know where to go. Has anyone had similar issues and tried different meds successfully? Any recommendations for meds? Also, how long to taper off zoloft and before i can try a new med? Thanks!',\n",

       " 'TRIGGER WARNING: had a week long panic attack for the first time, looking for closure and support Hi Everyone,\\n\\nI \\\\[25F\\\\] just experienced a week long panic cycle and I\\'m so incredibly shaken up by it, wanted to just dump because this subreddit feels so communal and safe, would love to hear your experiences and thoughts. Big trigger warning: psychedelics, derealization, going \"crazy,\" etc. \\n\\nI\\'ve always been an anxious person, but for the first time ever I felt like I just snapped. Never used to have panic attacks, but I had one while on psychedelics (mushrooms) back in July and it was a truly terrifying experience that I never really reckoned with. Now, two months later, something triggered me into a panic attack and the world didn\\'t feel real– similar to the way I felt while tripping. This sent me into even deeper panic as I convinced myself that this one bad trip fried my brain and I was never going to be the same, so for one week I was in a panicked cycle of feeling normal, checking if everything was actually normal, getting caught by an anxious thought, derealizing (completely unable to trust anyone or anything, including my senses and myself), thinking i was stuck this way forever, accepting the fact that i may have to unalive myself, and then ultimately coming out of it and the cycle repeating again. I had no idea what was going on, I\\'d never felt like this before and the challenging shrooms trip was the closest reference I had. \\n\\nI only was able to come out of it recently when I discovered this was cyclical and I physically wrote out the pattern of my panic. I\\'m also a performer and was headlining one of the biggest shows I\\'ve ever done the other night and I found being nervous for the show somehow made me so present that it actually healed me. This also validated that the shrooms didn\\'t ruin my life and that this was purely panic (if drugs fried my brain, I wouldn\\'t have control over how I did during the show etc). Also, I accepted for myself that my anxiety caused the bad trip, the bad trip did not cause my anxiety. On top of this, I realized that I had not stopped working/taken a weekend since May and life began to feel meaningless because of it/the stress played a huge part in triggering, what I ultimately consider, an existential crisis. \\n\\nToday is the first day I\\'m feeling better/normal, but I really thought this past week was going to be my last and I am just so exhausted. This feels like a new chapter in my life and my mental health has completely changed– this is now something I have to be aware of, when previously I thought I had a good grip on manageable anxiety. Wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience with having a big episode for the first time and dealing with the aftermath of it. I\\'m trying to not be, but I\\'m anxious at the thought of having another panic attack or stronger panic cycle, and I\\'m still not feeling 100% although I\\'m trying to be patient. Also, derealization is the scariest thing I have ever experienced– has anyone dealt with this?\\n\\nPlanning on seeing a psychiatrist for the first time and discussing medication.

They tell me that it is mutual for both of them. Anyway, we are all pretty stressed and admittedly not in the best head-spaces (given we are first year law students). \\n\\nI’ll be the first to admit I’ve had a horrible past few weeks with the stress of school having both a physical and mental toll on me. I really needed to open up to someone who understood (I.e, not my family or a therapist), and they seemed really supportive.

I am doing my best to be on an upward trend and take better care of myself. \\n\\nThe thing is, I can’t tell if they are doing things like not responding to my texts, hanging out without me, or declining to hang out with me after school (even to go study) because I annoy them/they don’t want to spend time with me, or because they just need a moment. I get anxious that I’m always the only one texting in our group chat or checking in on them outside of school. I send them pictures of my dog, or ask how studying is going and sometimes I get a response within a few hours, if at all. I try to message only once a day, and as this pattern goes on, I have been decreasing out of sheer hopelessness. \\n\\nThe two of them also seem to be closer than I am to them either individually or together.

       " 'My (24f) Anxiety is Preventing Me From Going to the Dentist (TW: Dentist Visits, Surgery, General Dental Issues) Some background: I suffer from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder. My family was VERY low middle class growing up (about $1-2k away from being classified as poor) so I generally didn\\'t see the dentist other than once or twice EVER and I\\'ve only been for teeth cleanings and an x-ray, the last time being almost 8 years ago.  \\nI actively go to a therapist but I\\'m not on any medication.\\n\\nWith that being said, I\\'m more than sure I have plaque build up, gum recession due to gingivitis, and probably a few cavities. My wisdom teeth are also coming in so some of those might be impacted, who knows? I\\'m in a position now where I\\'m insured and can \\\\*probably\\\\* afford a visit but my anxiety is preventing me from doing so.  \\nSome things racing through my mind:  \\n\"I\\'ve never had surgery, what if my gums are bad enough that I\\'ll have to have reconstruction done?\"  \\n\"If I do need surgery, what if I\\'m allergic to the anesthetic? What if I am allergic and they can\\'t help me and my teeth start rotting out of my skull?\"  \\n\"What if I can\\'t afford whatever my insurance doesn\\'t cover?\"\\n\\nAnd in general I\\'m just afraid of having my teeth drilled into, being judged by the dentist (I\\'m currently living around a very rich area, I can see the poverty shaming now), having to have anything pulled, having to have my wisdom teeth removed, and probably anything else related to stepping foot into a dental office. At the same time I\\'m having nightmares of my teeth rotting and falling out because I know I have to go at some point and that whatever issues I have are just getting worse.\\n\\nBasically I just need some general advice on how to attempt to manage my anxiety during a dental visit, and how to not have a panic attack in the chair/leave the office prematurely whilst crying. Literally anything is appreciated at this point.',\n",

I can’t ever talk to people, or make friends. I hear people  but don’t listen. While someone is talking, my mind is looking for a response and most of the time is not able to find a response and so it’s like my brain just freezes and I don’t know what to say. I was with my kids dad for 3 years and was almost always awkward around him. Couldn’t sing/dance or express myself around him. And I could feel his hate toward me for that. That’s the main reason I left, because of my mental health. I couldn’t be happy because of my anxiety. I Tried smoking and that actually makes it 100x worse. At work, it’s horrible.

       " 'My anxiety story Hi there, I‘m 24M with severe anxiety and I want to tell my story.\\n\\nSince I can think of, I have anxiety, but I never realized it until 2 years ago. \\n\\nWhen I was little (6 or 7 years old) I always thought about my parents dying and cried every night, I thought about the most cruel stuff happening to either loved ones or me, I never could fall asleep really well, so I had to keep my mind busy and stay awake until I‘m tired enough so I would fall asleep in less then 5 minutes, sometimes I was awake for two days. \\n\\nI always had to do multiple things at once to keep my mind distraced, like watching TV and playing a game, sometimes that won‘t even help and I have to do other stuff too. That‘s when I started to find hobbys, it first started with building PC‘s and coding, when I was 12 I made my own „video-game“ and a browser and I could literally build a PC blindfolded with one hand, I was sooo interested and it kept my mind busy, then with 14 I got into cars and bikes and always worked on them, it fascinated me, and I felt happy. I studied, I learnt so many stuff like drawing, playing piano, welding, soldering, basically everything interesting to me, just to keep me calm. \\n\\nSo then it happend, 2 years ago, two of my uncles died of cancer, I was in denial and I still am, but that really brought out the anxiety even more, I can‘t find new interesting hobbys I would want to learn, and even if, I‘m not interested in them, it‘s hard to explain, but I just don‘t want to do anything anymore, I want to stay at home in my safe „bubble“. I ghosted and ignored many friends I had, because of that, I feel not wanted or take little things too personal or just think „do they even like me?“ now, I‘m drowning in my anxiety, only thing that helps me is CBD but only for a few hours, I got it prescribed, could‘ve gotten Xanax too, but I don‘t like those type of „drugs“ or medicaments, I don‘t want to get addicted to it. \\n\\nYeah, so, few months ago, I started dating again after about 6 months, I was in a 4 year relationship before and I think my anxiety was the thing that ruined it, well, now I met a really interesting girl about a month ago and we went out and kissed, well, the thing is, she had a small cut on her lip that I just realized after kissing, and I was scared I might catch HIV or some STD, so I just stopped and started talking again, that was a mood killer, but I didn‘t feel safe anymore. That was about a week ago, we still text and everything is good but I‘m still worried, however I‘m pretty sure I haven’t gotten HIV, and I’m also pretty sure she doesn’t have it (she seemed normal, not ill, and trustworthy), it’s just my anxiety telling me. I still feel good and normal and the chances of getting HIV through kissing are really low, but that‘s just an example how anxiety fucks up my life, I start thinking I might have cancer because of a cough, or anything else, I‘m worried all the time, but most of the time, after like two weeks I’m scared of something new, not HIV anymore, it might be cancer, might be a car accident, or something else.\\n\\nIt isn‘t just health related stuff, I feel anxious in a large crowd, while shopping, driving a car, even little things. Even when talking with somebody my mind is always somewhere else. I really just want peace again, my therapist isn‘t much of a help, she just wants to prescribe me more drugs and isn‘t really interested in talking about my problems, I still don‘t know where I got my anxiety from, must be something from my early childhood. \\n\\nI just want to experience a normal life again, I‘m kind of jealous when I see other people, happy, no stress, no worries, I want that too. But I guess I won‘t experience that ever, only when taking CBD I feel joy, the first time I took CBD, I cried (what I never did before!) but it was out of joy. But I don‘t want and I can‘t take CBD every two hours, it can get really expensive.\\n\\nMy life now is basically a train wreck, almost no friends, dating doesn’t work, anxious thoughts all the time, taking cbd daily and melatonin too so I can atleast fall asleep quicker and sleep normal.\\n\\nThanks for reading',\n",

I have been googling shit to the point where it has stressed me out that much that I saw the doctor yesterday who has told me that I need to monitor this daily and he has sent me on an EKG, for bloods, a urine sample and a couple of other rando things. I still can\\'t help worrying about it and feel like I am just going to drop. I told my doctor about my anxiety but they said they can\\'t do a thing til they\\'ve worked out if it\\'s something else. They said the tests will take up to another 3 weeks which is quite a long time to be on edge. I don\\'t have too many supportive people around me but I have a lot of people that can help take the edge off it (pretty bad listeners in the family :( ).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI have felt on edge since Covid but I have previously either been able to control my anxiety or tell it to just \\'shut up\\'. Right now I feel like I have hit a breaking point with it as it just won\\'t let up or let me sleep or do anything. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhat isn\\'t helping is the fact that I\\'m not getting my full 8 hours of quality sleep - I\\'m getting to sleep fine around the 10:30 mark but then come 5-6am I\\'m up and anxious thoughts are flying. Eg \"what if my blood pressure spiked now and something happened?\" - probably sounds a bit pathetic i know. It\\'s taking me longer to wind down for bed (I\\'d normally start to relax now) and I\\'m not doing things that I enjoy doing on the basis that I just want to catch up on my sleep. I had no sleep before the operation (about 2-3 hours of very interrupted sleep) and have just felt that \\'on edge\\' over the past couple of days that I have just physically been like the walking dead lol.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy appetite has dropped a lot since the op which is possibly playing a part in all of this but I have tried eating an optimal amount today which hasn\\'t helped (just made me feel sick more than anything to be fair).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'ve only just got back to work after a few days off being not well; anaesthetic wearing off has sent me really \\'funny\\' and has put my emotions into a really weird state where I am alright one minute and next minute I am crying my eyes out over something trivial, ie my friends that I play online with not messaging me despite them having conflicting schedules (been nearly a week since i\\'ve seen any of them but whatevz). I\\'ve started having panic attacks much more frequently. I want to try to get over this or sort it out or at least recap on what I did before but my mind feels too exhausted from sleep deprivation to tell me (last time I ended up in hospital due to mistaking it as a heart attack).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'m hoping that it starts to calm down soon or I can remember more ways to cope with it but right now I feel kinda alone and afraid of what\\'s to come, especially with some of the horror stories i\\'ve heard about high blood pressure etc. I made the mistake of falling down the rabbit hole yesterday and am still anxiously googling stuff. I ended up having a panic attack over a fucking action film more than anything the other day, films that I normally absolutely love. I just feel like a bit of a mess.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI jut need to get through the next 2-3 weeks then I can get all the help I need is what I keep saying. Whether it\\'ll help me as I\\'m contemplating going up A&amp;E (for US peeps - the ER) later to see if they can expedite the tests I have no idea.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAgain sorry for the rather long vent, think my emotions are getting the better of me so I really hope that I can get this nipped in the bud soon enough. I hope it\\'s just a bad spell of anxious thoughts and that when I have slept on it or caught up on some quality sleep I\\'ll feel all the better for it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFor any of you reading this, that has been more than enough for me even if one person sees it.

       " 'Odd feeling I’ve been getting. So recently I developed an anxiety disorder and OCD (about two years ago). I’m on Paxil. I’ve been getting this odd sensation that’s a bit difficult to describe. I feel sometimes like I’m transported back in time, what I mean is if I listen to some songs I listened to back in the day, and if the weather is similar to how it was when I listened to those songs, I feel almost transported back. It’s a bit uncomfortable. It’s not always music that’s the cause either. Sometimes it happens if the weather alone feels how it did years ago, I can remember that specific day or what I was doing and I feel taken back. I know what nostalgia is and I don’t quite think it’s that. If I go to places I once visited years ago I can get that sensation too. It’s almost as if my mind is hijacked a bit and I feel like I’m pulled back in time based on it. A scent can trigger it, the weather, how I’m dressed, music, basically anything. It doesn’t happen all the time and most notably happens when I’m outside and either the weather, wind, or what I’m listening to triggers it.',\n",

       " 'Crazy anxiety symptoms- brain zaps, panic attacks, etc. This is my first post hi everyone!\\n\\nSO I\\'m currently going through the most intense manifestation of stress/ anxiety in my life and I\\'m wondering if anyone can relate.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFor some background, I\\'m an actor and I just finished a summer contract in Maine. I was at home in LA when I got sick with a bad cold (tested for covid twice and was negative.) While I was sick, I would have episodes of pretty intense head pressure that would last 30 minutes or so. Now, I\\'m not a person who generally gets headaches, s this was pretty surprising, but I figured it must be because I was sick. When I started to feel better, I noticed that I was still having headaches that turned into pain at the base of my skull. I moved back to NYC at this point, and the pain got increasingly worse. I went to urgent care because I thought I might have meningitis (I have pretty intense health anxiety) and they sent me home saying I was fine. The headaches kept getting worse, and I went to the ER and got a CT scan which was normal. After I went home the headaches started to turn into intense back and chest pain. I went back to the ER thinking something was wrong with my heart. Of course, all tests came back normal. I was told that I was having an \"atypical\" migraine. A few days later my symptoms started getting better and I saw a neurologist who did an EEG and other tests, all of which were normal. He ordered MRIs of my brain, neck, and multiple areas of my spine. I was so anxious and in so much pain that I had the brain/ neck MRI early in the ER. AT this point, I was convinced I had a brain tumor, but of course the MRI came back normal. \\n\\nSince the headaches and body aches have gotten better, I\\'ve noticed new debilitating symptoms. I\\'ll have what I can only refer to as brain zaps all throughout the day. They are a little bit different from the zaps that come with SSRIs, but almost feel as if my brain is \"skipping\". I\\'ll feel anything from the electric shock of a real brain zap, to feeling like I\\'m spacing out for a split second and then I\\'ll come back. I\\'ll have these at times every 30 seconds are so. They are accompanied by occasional panic attacks during which I feel dizzy and faint and fear that I will pass out, night sweats, waking up in the middle of the night feeling incredibly nauseas and feverish, and occasional waves of terror that wash over me. \\n\\nI have yet to have the other MRIs but my symptoms are so varied that I\\'m sure this is all anxiety. I do worry though, because the brain zaps really feel like seizures. I was prescribed gabapentin, which I  have been on since yesterday and it has barely made a dent so far. I\\'m just curious to see if anyone else has had a similar experience, and particularly brain zaps without withdrawing from SSRIS.\\n\\nThanks for reading everybody &lt;3',\n",

It all started this damn Saturday when for the first time I had my first panic attack. Since then it’s like a switch that never turns off. Constant  Physical symptoms like fast heart rate, heart palpitations out of the blue, constant dizziness, tingling in legs, cold and hot flashes, scared of what people will think of you or say to you, overthinking Every. Single. Thing you are doing, habits like biting your nails or leg fidgeting, unable to sleep well without waking up gasping for air or waking up every half an hour. it’s a circle that never ends. Ever. It never ever ends. Will it be forever like this? This thought crossed my mind a million times. I can’t live the life I want cause anxiety holds me back. No I can’t have a nice dinner with my loved ones, I can’t watch a movie at the cinema with my friends, I can’t ride roller coasters, damn I can’t even take the bus without feeling my heart racing. I CANNOT enjoy ANYTHING in my life cause I’m just so anxious for absolutely NO reason. “Eat better”, “exercise” sure it helps. But if you don’t do that for like 2 days that’s it, you go back to anxious state. This isn’t a life. Anxiety is a curse on earth, it’s worse that Hell and I wouldn’t wish it to my worst enemy. It robs you from your own life, it dooms you forever. I wanna do wild things, I wanna go places I haven’t been, I wanna meet new people, I wanna be completely free of the anxiety chains but they will never break and I might as well try to accept it.

Don’t get me wrong I have no problem with aging or looking older. My “issue” is more on the mental and emotional side of things. I know that as I get older I will never be who I once was. I’ll have to make long standing commitments and every choice I ever make will have reverberating consequences throughout my entire life. But I have no idea what those consequences will be or what the future will hold. Whenever people asked me what a wanted to be when I “grow up” I could never give a legitimate answer. I hate the idea that I have to conform to a set identity. That I have to be (insert my name here). Meanwhile while I’ve got all this shit going on inside my head all my loved ones are all excited with their puckered grins. “Oh 22! Are you excited for your birthday?

This will be a long post, so I implore you to stick to the very end. \\n\\nI’m a 21-year-old student currently in my third year of university, and I would just like to rant about my anxiety. \\n\\nBefore the pandemic, I went into college expecting everything to adhere to the typical university fantasy—an active social life, amazing extracurriculars, academic achievement, etc; and I was actually on track to make at least a part of this a reality during the first semester of my freshman year. However, as my second freshman semester progressed, COVID-19 suddenly came out of nowhere, the world was put on hold, and I stayed idle for a bit.\\n\\nThe first few months passed by uneventfully, but as my university moved towards a fully-online setup, something changed, and it suddenly became harder for me to pay attention to my lectures and to my academics. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Physics, and I used to think that I had a passion for the subject as a freshman, but during the pandemic I ended up languishing and slacking off. I suddenly fell behind on my classes—concepts became harder to understand, I received mediocre grades, and my academic sense of urgency just completely disappeared. \\n\\nAll of this, combined with turmoil in my relationships and me pushing my friends and loved ones away as a result of my isolation, has contributed to me developing acute depression and anxiety, and my actions which led to developing this disorder remains one of my greatest regrets as I am still suffering the effects of these actions to this very day.\\n\\nI am currently back in university, but I feel like such a shell of my former self. I had to take an informal “Leave of Absence” from my university for one semester last year, and even if I am supposed to be graduating next year, I still am considered a sophomore credits-wise, and being 21 years old, I feel like I am running out of time.\\n\\nI do not know how to get back into the hobbies I once enjoyed (reading and music being my main ones), and every time I think of academics I always get hit by a severe wave of anxiety and nausea.\\n\\nI am trying to get myself back in track, as I am doing my best to schedule my academic work along with subjects I haven’t completed yet via a task-scheduler such as Todoist, but I feel like such an imposter. I haven’t told my parents about my leave of absence yet, and feeling that I might graduate super late stresses me out to no end.  I feel like a fraud for essentially doing nothing during my “online” university semesters, and now that I a, getting back into face-to-face classes, I feel lost and unsure how to navigate this space once again.\\n\\nWhenever I try getting work done, I always get stuck in the “scheduling” phase, as my brain continually tells me about how I need to get EVERYTHING ironed out before doing the real work. I also feel severe anxiety whenever I try communicating out to my professors and groupmates online, as I fear that they would be judging my for replying and reaching out too late in the semester. I always freeze in front of the computer whenever I am about to email them, and I end up flaking again and again.\\n\\nAll of this anxiety has also taken a toll on my social life. I am lucky to have a supportive girlfriend who has been with me through thick and thin, yet I worry because sometimes I think I become too clingy and overattached to her due to my anxiety issues, and that that may just drive her away. My brain constantly overthinks all of her interactions with me, and sometimes it makes me think of scenarios whenever she goes out without me. I sometimes think that I am constantly “bundled” with her whenever she does something, and I am painfully aware of it. I love her so much and I do not want to push her way, and this is why I hate my anxiety so much.\\n\\nI have also pushed away so many people away during the pandemic, and I am at a loss on how to reach out to them once again. My brain tells me that I am the bad one for suddenly disappearing and hiding away from them, and yet whenever I try reaching out my anxiety takes over and makes me think of different scenarios about them rejecting me, ignoring me, etc. I have withdrawn from all social media, yet I yearn to restart my social life and reach out to people once again.\\n\\nAll of this anxiety culminated in an episode last week. As I was alone in my dorm room about to visit a family event, my anxiety overpowered me in such a manner that it manifested as loud voices in my head, ending up with me on the floor alone, clutching my head having a severe. panic attack. It took me hours to recover, and worst of all, I still went ahead and attended my family event, having to put up a façade that everything was okay. \\n\\nThe mere act of writing this down in words, however, has comforted me a little, and I would just like to ask if any of you can offer advice or some words on how to slowly get back up. As of now, I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom, though I desperately want to become better again. It’s just that the voices in my head have been too loud as of late, and I am trying to seek ways on how to slowly become better again and to get rid of these anxious tendencies.\\n\\nIf you have reached this part, I sincerely thank you. Just knowing someone out there has listened makes me more at ease, and I wish you good luck in whatever this is we call life.\\n\\nSincerely yours,\\nOP\\n\\nTL;DR: Developed anxiety because of pandemic, pushed people away, faced turmoil in lots of my relationships. Now feeling that I have lost my passion for my academics and for life, and am extremely anxious with reaching out to the people I have disappeared from. Need advice with getting back up and getting rid of anxiety.',\n",

       " 'I\\'m a failure. Hello everyone, M28 (29 in feb), i live in south Italy and for the last year i\\'ve been dealing With anxiety attacks, the \"Heart Is racing i\\'m having an Heart Attack\" kind. The fact that i\\'m obese and a smoker Doesn\\'t really help. Been obese since i was at least 15 and smoking since 2013 circa. I Always hated my body but never did anything to improve myself until i reached a \"fuck, i\\'m gonna die young if i keep going Like this\" Moment in around 2018.My maximum weight was 163kg, i was so fat that even walking my dog for 10 minutes caused me back pain and fatigue. So i decided to go to a nutrinionist and in a year (With no exercise cause i\\'m a lazy ass) i\\'ve lost 50kg, still obese but With basically another human being off mu back while walking. I felt great. While i started my new diet i\\'d also found my First ever job, i was 24 and never worked before. I tried going to universities but Always quit cause i felt Like i did not have It in me to finish what i was starting. Work goes good, i freaked out in the first week cause i was changing my oh so comfortable routine of doing nothing but playing videogames, but i adapted. It was only a 6months gig, but it\\'s still experience i guess.2019 was probably the best year of my life, nothing extraordinary was happening but i was able to do stuff i previously not allow myself to do, like going to parties, going out With people i barely knew and stuff. My girlfriend has been by my side since 2012. Next month Is our 10th year together and we both loved eachother in pur best and worst moments. My family has Always been in a tight spot when It comes to Money, they never actually denied me something but still i understood when to aks for Money and when to help of i could. I am really attached to my family, this probably sounds silly for american readers or someone else, but here in Italy it\\'s still a thing to live With your parents till you reach your 30s, for some people Is a necessity, Like in my case. Since my First job i didn\\'t really found something else, i still did not have a driving license (could not afford It at the time) and that made me think \"i can\\'t find a job without a car\". 2020 starts and i finally can get a driver\\'s license! Of course covid hits before i could do my theory exam. Family did not work for the majority of the year and Life was getting pretty depressing. I regained 30kg. I could blame It on covid but i know it\\'s my fault, i\\'d already started not respecting my diet in the last months of 2019, so it\\'s totally on me. If 2020 succede ass, 2021 was the cherry on top. My girlfriend\\'s father suffered from diabetes, he lived alone and only my GF and her sister took care of Him when they could. He was the kind of guy that did not give much thought on treatments and stuff, and living alone he was also depressed and drank all he could. I knew Him, i was not really close to Him but he never was a Dick to me or something, he was troubled, but a good man. Long story short: After a year of dhialisis, drinking, smoking and suffering he got covid, then all his organs started failing Him and After 4 days in an hospital bed he died, in his 50\\'s. That was the First really close loss i suffered in about 20years or so. In the same period my father started having intense headaches and found out he has High Blood pressure, he\\'s on the pill thingy and ok now, but since that happened i\\'m Always scared something might happen to Him.  If his BP Is too High when we measure It i start panicking and i feel my Heart going insane. Since then i\\'m convinced i also suffer from High BP and probably have diabetes too, i\\'m too scared to get tested and i Just panick at the idea i might have some of those things. My family never had diabetes cases, unlike my GF\\'s father, all his Brothers have It to, so it\\'s probably genetic. What haunts me to this day Is the phone call i got when my GF learned her father passed... She was crying and screaming, and She said something so innocent and sincere that It makes me cry even now: \"i don\\'t have a father anymore\".\\n\\nThe thought of losing my loved ones now Is super scary to me, and i\\'m also paranoid about my Healt. Also, i Just got a job in a callcenter, we call people and try to sell them stuff, it\\'s been 2 days and i\\'m on my way to work now, and i feel so anxious every time... I cringe at the thought of talking to people on the phone, and the thing that stresses me the most Is that i\\'m now breaking my routine of doing nothing all the time and complain that i don\\'t have a job. I\\'m 28 and i want to be indipendent but i\\'m scared of changing my routine of complaining about finding a job, laying in   \\nmy bed while watching YouTube or Twitch and playing videogames. That\\'s what i am. I honestly am Better today than i was 2 days ago, so i probably should Just adapt to this new routine and give It a go, but my brain and body try so hard to not let me try this... Anytime i have to go out now seems Like a super hard Quest, i\\'m almost scared of going to a movie  don\\'t even know why i\\'m saying this, probably feels Better to write It Down somewhere. I know i should see my nutrinionist again, i probably Will. I know i should quit smoking, i know i should get tested for my health paranoia, i know all that. It\\'s Just so hard, even if It isn\\'t. I\\'m a failure.',\n",

While it helped immensely with depression, my anxieties are still there. Therefore I wanna ask you what are my choices/or what do you use? As I see it it's either benzos (Xanax, Valium) or Buspor if I wanna avoid SSRI/SNRI and keep it as a last resort.\\n\\nI eventually also wanna commit to therapy and see if that's gonna do something.\\n\\nAlso I tried MDMA first time ever while being on Wellbutrin and it was nice but it also made me anxious too (maybe just the setup). Next 2 days I was kinda okeyish and then my anxieties actually eased for like a week which is kinda weird (obviously I can't prove that Molly was the reason) So maybe MDMA induced therapy could be something I should look into... or those serotonin inhibitors eventually as MDMA spike serotonin 🤷\\u200d♂️\",\n",

I’m constantly on edge just taking my dog out in the yard to use the bathroom. I’m trans on top of that, which doesn’t help in the slightest bit.  I probably would’ve finished my senior year even with my debilitating anxiety if my therapist and councilor hadn’t decided to fuck me over.. so I dropped out and tried to focus on bettering myself. Went off my medication in feb. This year after being sick for 4 months which by the way it took my family till the 2nd month in to take me to the ER. but they took my brother within the 2nd day of him showing any I’ll symptoms. (Love that) after I went off my meds I spiraled into a depression. I honestly didn’t think I could get more depressed while on the meds but lucky me I could and did. I couldn’t even get myself out of bed to eat shower or anything.. I would wait till my bladder felt like exploding to get up and then lay back down after going to the bathroom. I gained a lot of weight while “bettering” myself. I tried eating three meals a day, doing things I enjoy, going out of my comfort zone, and overall just trying to do better. I worked on coping etc. (&lt;-before I got sick)(after going off meds-&gt;) I barely showered every week after about 2 months of this I started trying to find coping mechanisms that would help. I started trying to shower more. (I’m a hygiene freak so if I’m not showering yes you should be worried) started doing better and was actually able to get myself to eat at least one meal a day and shower every 3-4 days. I started doing better actually started getting up (kinda) and doing things sometimes I’d even shower every 2 days. After starving myself for several months and falling back into an ED I lost 40-ish pounds and was now showering every 2 days. Still didn’t leave the house though. I’ve gotten to a point where I can shower everyday/every other and it’s not that hard to get myself to do it. I eat about 1-2 meals a day and I’ve actually went out twice recently to the store with my mom. I never thought I could get worse when I was taking those pills until I actually went off of them. It’s not that I was at a lower level it’s that the meds helped me maintain those emotions even if I felt numb 24/7 I still would rather be that way then crying over every little thing and getting REALLY angry over nothing like I do now. I don’t want to go into to much detail and I’ve made this a lot longer then I meant to but I can’t really rely on anyone or anything.. hell.. I’m waiting for my family to get tired of me and kick me out to be completely honest..  I know this went off the topic of anxiety but I was trying to give more context. I feel so alone nobody messages me unless they need something and I feel like an inconvenience and a leech to my family. I didn’t finish school so no job would want me even if I did somehow magically overcome my disabling anxiety and apply somewhere. Im terrified of being reliant on anything really.. I feel like I’ll become dependent and have it ripped out from under me. That’s why I stopped my medications .. I know eventually my insurance will cut me since I’m above 18.  I don’t even really want to get into the whole trans shit.. I know there’s people who don’t understand and won’t be able to understand my situation so I really just don’t feel like touching on that topic.. just that it also keeps me from doing things I want to.

She assaulted me earlier this year because I didn’t feel safe getting in the car with her. She tried physically dragging me out of the house. I’m not a very big person so if shit were to go south I couldn’t do much.. I’m pretty much the smallest in my family and it scares me because I know they realize how helpless I’d be in a physical altercation.. they put on smiles and we play family until someone snaps and then the next day it’s back to being all sunshine and pretending nothing happened.. I can’t even express how I feel because I’m terrified my mom will flip a switch. I’m sorry I made this so long.. I might not even post it now I was supposed to talk about how I need a job and basically get advice.. I don’t think I can be dependent much longer.. I really wish I just had the guts to end it or that I had followed through when I was 14. I feel wrong referring to myself as disabled because of my issues and it makes me feel stupid because I’m physically capable.. but I also know that my issues are very real.. and the best way to describe them would be a handicap of sorts. I’m so angry with how I let this all control me.. I see people around my age or younger already adulting and shit and I feel so helpless .. I don’t even know how to cook myself food without instructions…and that’s when I’m using the microwave. I’m so fucking dependent it hurts.. I was never really shown how to take care of myself or “adult” and I guess the realization of me being alive and at the age of starting to “adult”. Is hitting me like a brick wall. I never thought I’d live this long.. I never thought this far a head and now I’m just dumbfounded as to what to do.

I am still trying to pin point what exactly is wrong with me, and decided that I might as well make a post to get some anecdotal data.\\n\\nSo I’ll start by stating as many symptoms of what I’ve been experiencing as I can think of at the moment, but take into account that not all of these symptoms were felt at the same time every time, but instead a random mixture of them. Sometime all though.\\nBrain fog, to the point where it’s hard to have simple conversations with others, let alone anything that requires me to recall something or articulate myself in any fashion. I have went through many phases where nothing interests me, not even going to the gym which has been my favorite hobby since I was 15. It became more of a chore. My confidence is in the trash can, physical and intelectual. I genuinely feel stupid when I’m going through one of the spurts. I seemingly am actively forgetting things that I have known forever and even find it harder to recall memories. Much less learn anything new. It makes it hard to do my job, and unfortunately I’m in the military and have no choice but to continue going to work. I seemingly forget how to socialize, making everything I do awkward. I lose all wittiness and sense of humor. I find myself staring off into space a lot with literally nothing on my mind. One of the biggest problems is I feel anxious around anyone, whether it be family, friends, girlfriend, stranger, coworker, literally anyone. Typically I am not this way at all, I can have good conversation with a stranger or someone I am meeting for the first time with little to no anxiety.\\n\\nI’m going to stop there because I’m doing a really shitty job at explaining myself. \\n\\nBut I experience these symptoms in spurts of 2-4 weeks sometimes longer, and then feel better or sometimes even really good for 1-2 weeks. Sometimes a little longer, each time has been different. Every time it has come on differently too, sometimes there is a cause for me going through a funk, but other times it’s like a switch. One day I’ll be fine and the next everything changes for no reason. I can’t keep going like this, I can’t set any ambitious goals anymore because I know I’ll just fall back into a funk and there’s no telling how long it will last. All the goals that I had previously have past, due to the constant mental issues I’ve been dealing with. My only real goal is to resolve this issue and go back to how I was the last 19 years of my life. Yeah sure I had ups and downs, but nothing compared to this. I feel like I could deal with being sad but my cognitive ability on almost every level I need it to function being obstructed is something I can’t constantly deal with. It has affected my career, my relationship, my friendships, and has changed me for the worse. I just want to go back to how I was before. I would literally do or try anything. I have seen 2 therapist and am currently seeing one but I don’t think it’s helping. I’m desperate. I have literally ruled out continuing my career in the military because of this. I can’t be a leader and be mentally unstable. There’s so much more to this that it would take me days to write everything. I don’t know if this really captures the severity of my situation, but it is the number one thing on my mind all day everyday and I can’t get rid of it. I live in constant fear that I will go back into a funk, if I’m not already in one. I will probably make another post eventually and try to make a more coherent post, but I want to make something in the meantime to get some responses and maybe some things I could do or try.',\n",

I got my sleeping schedule fixed so that I can start attending classes as I should from next week.  If I'm kicked out of my course this will be the last straw for me. I'm trying really hard. If I wasn't so fucking unlucky and haven't gotten ill this week I would've shown up, or at least if I wrote them an email explaining the situation. I hate myself for this. I'm literally panicking I won't be able to sleep until the morning I'm so worried, my dad will be so disappointed once again if they kicked me out, I don't want to be an embarrassment. The school is aware that I've got mental health issues so I just hope they will understand when I call them tomorrow, but I just can't stop feeling anxious and depressed atm.. \\n\\nI probably don't deserve it, I sabotaged myself but I just need some reassurance so that I can at least fall asleep :(\",\n",
       " 'Gf gets anxious during arguments, becoming aggressive/emotional So my gf and I have been dating for 7 months now. She has anxiety and depression. Generally, this doesn’t pose much of an issue besides when there is an inconvenience and she gets really frustrated and I reassure her…and when we argue. \\n\\nSo when we argue, it usually starts off civil, and she is immediate to apologize. But frankly, she just apologizes without taking accountability or really understand how my grievance made me feel. So when I am trying to express my feelings entirely and really drill my point, she will often get emotional and defensive, and say that I am dragging things and being too harsh on her.\\n\\nIt then upsets me that she thinks I’m being harsh when all I’m doing is expressing my feelings. She’ll then start to get aggressive, talk in a louder and sassy tone, misconstruing what I say, etc…basically she becomes a whole different person. It makes conflict resolution with her really hard…her getting emotional makes it harder for her to think and discuss rationally.\\n\\nAfter our most recent argument was resolved after 2 days, she apologized and told me she gets like that because when we argue, she gets anxious. And when she gets anxious, she becomes emotional, aggressive, and most of all irrational. \\n\\nDoes anyone have advice on how both of us can work together in arguing productively and not letting her anxiety get the best of her?',\n",

So yeah, here goes. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's half past midnight, but I'm still up.

At first the thought seemed almost foreign which was rather strange because I had always defaulted to the fantasy of letting go. But it's different when you actually start to plan it in your head. You start thinking of all the things you'll touch and feel for the last time, all the people you'll leave and hurt. Then for a moment as if it were an epiphany, you start to wonder what all those years of depression meant if you had no real intention to kill yourself. Was it really depression? If I'm not going to die then what will I do with my life? These are some of the thoughts that pop into my head. \\n\\n\\nI'm sinking to places deeper than darkness. A place with no return.

       " 'DAE: Extreme anxiety around disappointing/angering perceived figures of authority Hi!\\n\\nI\\'ll preface that this is a half-vent, half \"does anyone else experience this?\". I know that the answer to that question is always \"yes, there are billions of people, of course someone else has experienced that\", but I\\'m particularly curious to hear if anyone else has figured out any coping methods or strategies to deal with this specific anxiety. There\\'s a TLDR at the bottom.\\n\\nSo, anyway, for as long as I can remember, I have had an extreme anxiety around disappointing or angering \"figures of authority\". This used to be teachers and school staff when I was younger, but by adulthood it\\'s changed to be towards managers at my job, doctors, police, etc.\\n\\nI\\'ll illustrate with a couple anecdotes and what I think they represent:\\n\\n**I often feel the impact of the anger/disappointment of authority figures more negatively than those around me:**\\n\\n- When I was in highschool, a teacher gave us permission to use his glitter on some posters for an extracurricular. He comes back half an hour later and yells at us for using too much glitter, and don\\'t we know how expensive glitter is? Everyone else snickered after he left, like \"can you believe it?\", but I was honestly on the verge of tears even though it wasn\\'t directed at me specifically.\\n\\n**I often feel that authority figures feel more negatively toward me than they actually do:**\\n\\n- While I was on vacation away from my part time job, my manager messaged me asking me to justify some hours I had clocked to a particular client. I\\'ll admit I probably clocked too many hours to the client for the amount of work I was doing, but that manager knew I had very little to do and didn\\'t assign me any more work despite me asking multiple times. I was required to work a certain amount of hours each week, so I did my best to scrape together some work. After his message, my brain catastrophized that he would fire me for time fraud and I was sobbing for probably 2 hours. It ended up being completely fine after I pulled myself together.\\n\\nI also am sensitive to perceived injustice in these kinds of situations. For example, if a figure of authority were to feel negatively towards me for something they thought I did, but I didn\\'t actually do, I would be so much more distraught. Or if an authority treated me in a condescending/dismissive way that suggests they don\\'t take me seriously, I would immediately freeze up and be unable to ask them for whatever I was trying to ask them for.\\n\\n**I often feel I cannot defend myself when authority figures treat me \"unfairly\" or \"dismissively\" (subjektive):**\\n\\n- When I was in high school, one of my teachers had a strict \"no drinking water in class\" rule. I came in one day coming down with some kind of flu, shivering and wrapped up in a parka coat. I was also devouring cough drops and brought some water to help stay hydrated. I was feeling miserable and forgot about his rule and drank some water. He called me out in front of the entire class, and I (already feeling like absolute trash) just started silently crying. My friends had to defend me to him. I felt his rule was so dumb and such a power trip, that he lacked empathy for the needs of his students, and being disciplined for violating a dumb rule really upset me. I\\'m normally so careful about sticking to rules, it just hurt extra that one slipup and I\\'m treated like a degenerate for wanting water while I\\'m sick.\\n\\nMy reaction to when these situations happen is almost universally choking up, lump in my throat, and an urge to cry (which is extremely difficult to suppress in situations where it would be inappropriate, like at work). It\\'s not a sad crying, it\\'s more of a stress/fear crying? Like a \"oh my god the world is going end because of this thing I did.

       " \"I cannot remember much - everything is a haze This is my first time posting on here so I am not sure if it's ok. I have always struggled with anxiety - I can remember being as young as 6 and exhibiting anxious symptoms. Some of my earliest memories are of very vivid sheer panic. I only found out what anxiety was and started treating it a few years ago - I grew up in a conservative country and an abusive home where mental health was not looked after. Since I started therapy, I have been finding ways of dealing with it all, but it just so happens that every time I get a grasp and learn to manage my symptoms, something happens that will set me back years.  \\n\\nI lost my dream job, then it was the uncertainty of the pandemic, then I got ill and I have been struggling with my health ever since; failed friendships, hopeless property hunting putting a strain on my relationship, reliving the same awful day for years now - a lot has been going very wrong for a very long time. The last time I felt like anything mattered was in 2019. The last few years have been one thing snowballing after another, and I am increasingly finding that I just can't cope most days and I have completely checked out of real life. It has made me feel really weak, thin skinned and like I am lacking resilience. I look at everyone around me going through life seemingly unharmed, and I feel like the smallest gust of upset ruins me.\\n\\nOne thing that has been bothering me more and more lately is memory lapses and feeling like I live in a dream. As a birthday gift, I got some tickets to see a show with someone I really admire. It was my absolute drive to get better for many weeks, and for the first time in a long while I was looking forward to an event instead of trying to avoid it. The show was incredible and I was in complete awe but the only problem is that I don't remember it. It all feels like a haze - it's hard to describe but I suppose it feels somewhat similar to waking up from a dream and being unable to piece together what it was about - you only have some vague scattered pieces that make no sense. I was really looking forward to this experience but my mind has completely erased it - and now I can not even enjoy the memory of seeing one of my favourite people. This has been happening for a little while now but I've reached a point where it's just really robbing me off the last few good things I have left.\\n\\nI suppose this is part venting and part expressing concern and frustration - I am not sure what is happening to me and why experiences keep being erased and scattered around my memory. I feel like I cannot even enjoy the good things that happen to me. Has anyone else experienced this?\",\n",

Although, my maintenance loan did not come through and I’m relying on that for the cost of public transport. I managed to scrape together some change, got on the bus but the time I needed to be at my lecture meant I had to get on the school bus which was packed with people about 2 millimetres from my face, I felt so anxious that I was going to be sick so I quickly got off the bus as the next stop. I somehow lost my phone while getting off the bus. \\n\\nI only realised because my music from my AirPods suddenly stopped… I had no idea I even dropped my phone. \\n\\nAnyways, I went back to that area later trying to retrieve it but obviously someone had taken it. \\n\\nI was freaking out. I use my phone for everything. I need to listen to music whenever I’m in public as it’s the only thing that manages my anxiety. I had my uni timetable on my phone, so I couldn’t go to my classes. I had no money to get a notebook for my classes. Next thing I knew I came down bad with flu, my body was aching all over and my temperature suddenly went really high. I went home and was dealing with panic attacks as well as severe flu like symptoms. \\n\\nThings took a turn for the worse, I suddenly got an email saying that I’m unable to advance to year 2 of uni as I “failed” 2 modules from last year. By failed I mean I had done the assignments before the deadline but was unable to upload them in time as I was working constantly at the time to get away from an emotionally abusive home. \\n\\nI tried to apply for an extension, but my uni is so unorganised that 1) I was sent the wrong extension form and 2) it was only after the deadline that they decided to tell me it was the wrong form. (If you don’t apply for an extension before the assessment deadline, you automatically fail). \\n\\nMy heart sank. I had no idea what I was going to do. I didn’t have access to a laptop at home, and could not make it to the uni library as I was working full time and was exhausted and drained whenever I had a day off. I tried to submit an academic appeal as it was the uni’s fault I failed my assignments. \\n\\nHowever, things got even worse today. For starters, I missed my theory test as I was too sick. They get booked up quick in my area, and the next available dates aren’t until January 2023. Then, when I thought things couldn’t get worse well of course it does because my life is shit and GUESS WHAT it turns out apparently I can’t even do year 2 of my course and I’m guessing that means I won’t get my maintenance loan even tho it says “ready to be paid” and says within 3 days of the date (which was Monday 26th). \\n\\nI’m shitting myself idk what to do my grandma lent me the money surprisingly to get an iPhone 7 which I got secondhand for £130 which arrived today. She has often been emotionally abusive throughout my life but has weird spurs and phases of generosity so I was shocked that she even offered to buy me a replacement phone. I said I would pay her back when I got my uni loan but I probably won’t even get that now ugh idk what to do\\n\\n\\nI know my grandma is going to be so pissed off that I failed my uni year (I live with her). She has always been controlling of my life and has explosive outbursts of anger over small things.

The thing is, 1 hour and 5 minutes before I had sex with her I was home and give myself a handjob and I did cum. The stupid thing was that I did only clean the outside of my (foreskin)dick, but not inside the foreskin. My dick foreskin is not cut (not cutted) so I have quite some foreskin over the head. I also know that there can still leak some sperm out after cumming and when you are aroused pre cum is made, maybe I was aroused and some sperm still came out between the time I was on my way to her and she putting a condom on.\\n\\nSo 55/60 minutes later I’m at her place and we start to wear our clothes off. She then proceeds to put a condom around my dick with her mouth. But because I have quite some foreskin, she needed to push down the foreskin to below so the penis head would be visible. She pushed my foreskin below with both hands each 4 fingers (I’m not sure how she pushed my foreskin to below, maybe with all her fingers or with her handpalm so more sperm could be on her fingers/hands), but she didn’t touch my penis head. After that she put with her mouth the condom over my penis head and then rolls the condom further down with her fingers/hands. This is I guess how sperm was maybe transferred from underneath/inside (within) the foreskin when she touched it while pulling it down to below to the outside of the condom (the condom likely didn’t contain spermicide because it was flavored).\\n\\nThen she gave my a blowjob with the condom on, so maybe that has influence on the sperm/cum on the outside of the condom. After the blowjob she did touch my dick again (to put it inside her), but at that point she has touched my body skin, a lube, duvet (and probably more I guess).\\n\\nAfter that we had sex and I did not cum inside the condom but outside on her boobs (wanted to be sure nothing happend, but stupid me…). That’s it. The time between the condom around my dick and actually having sex was 8-10 minutes or something (she gave my a little massage in the mean time). No idea if the 8 minutes would also have some effect?\\n\\nInformation:\\n\\nI have heard/read sperm can survive longer under the foreskin (it’s not quite open air) but I’m not sure how long?\\n\\nI don’t think she used birth control pills or something, but lets assume she did not used it (so lets assume she was NOT on birth control)\\n\\nI can’t contact her anymore because after the day we had sex, she deleted her profile/advertise and wasn’t reachable on the phone. I did try to get to her place where we had sex but got a fist in my face (from I guess the man who is controlling them) and was told to leave immediately. I guess she was working under bad circumstances and I wished I had caught that on the time I met with her and had sex.\\n\\nThe condom likely did not contain spermicide, because it was a flavored (purple) condom.\\n\\nThe condom didn’t break.\\n\\nHer advertisement was not online anymore after 2 - 4 days.\\n\\nReally scared she can be pregnant of this? This happend 33 weeks and a couple of days ago.',\n",

English is not my my first language, so please bear with me.\\n\\nI hope this post will help some of you, who are suffering from anxiety or panic attacks.\\n\\nEverything began with an initial panic attack due to severe stress.\\n\\nHorrible lifestyle (poor diet, horrible sleeping routine, lack of exercise) + mental stress let to this point in my life.\\n\\nAfter suffering from this initial panic attack my life changed to the worse.I thought \"just sleep a night on it and everything will be fine\"...oh boy, was i wrong...\\n\\nI developed a **severe Emetophobia** (fear of throwing up) and **panic disorder.**\\n\\nThe first years i arranged my life to \"live with it\" and kinda lost myself in a victim mentality.\\n\\n*\"Poor me.\"*\\n\\n*\"Why is this happening to me?\"*\\n\\nAt this time, i didnt know, that i f\\\\*cked myself over with this kind of mentality, but we get to that later ;)\\n\\n**Fast forward // \\\\~5 years into the disorder** i lived through the most horrific panic attack while going to the cinema with my girlfriend. The world around me was spinning and i couldn\\'t move for what felt an eternity.\\n\\nAfter this incident, my mental and physical health were spiraling down rapidly. I lost 15Kg in 3 1/2 month...couldn\\'t eat, couldn\\'t sleep, couldn\\'t even leave my house without having severe panic attacks.\\n\\nI thought that it is over...the only future i had, was in a mental asylum on forced medication.\\n\\nLucky me, having a girlfriend with a (let\\'s call it) \"drill instructor mentality\" (russian pragmatism i guess), she forced my into deep self-reflection and CHANGE.\\n\\nWithout her, i would be dead...\\n\\n*Quick note: I\\'ve always have been a person with a severe authority problem. So doctors, therapy and medication were never a real option for me...even on the brink of death (maybe i am dramatizing, but it sure felt like it).*\\n\\nSo i took my healing into my own hands!\\n\\nI read a heap of books, watched alot of videos and tried alot of things/methods. I will link the (imo) most important sources at the end of this text.\\n\\n**BUT LET\\'S CUT TO THE CHASE!**\\n\\nThe most important tools on my journey were:\\n\\n* Mindfulness / Meditation\\n* Acceptance\\n* A healthy, NATURAL lifestyle\\n* Spirituality\\n\\nLet me elaborate on those points:\\n\\n**Mindfulness / Meditation**\\n\\nA big part of anxiety lives from judging our own thoughts. And most of the time, these thoughts are about the past or the future...in case of anxiety the \"future thoughts\" are the BIG PLAYER.Because when we over and over think about things, that COULD happen, we are forcing our body into fight or flight mode (ANXIETY).\\n\\nThats how our brains work and should work: It should protect us from a possible threat. And the brain does not differentiate between a \"real\" threat and a \"fantasy\".\\n\\nThe moment we judge the thought, identify with it and are conviced that this is the truth, it\\'s a \"real\" threat to the brain. And when there is a threat, there is anxiety. A normal reaction.\\n\\n**The problem is not the anxiety or the thought. It\\'s the judgement of this thoughts / symptoms and the identification with it.**\\n\\nWe have to see thoughts as what they really are: JUST THOUGHTS.\\n\\nThere is nothing like a negative or positive thought. This is just something we tell ourselves based on the content of the thought.\\n\\nAlso, there is nothing like a negative or positive feeling. It\\'s just a story we tell about the feeling.\\n\\nFeelings are just bodily sensations!\\n\\n**The big problem with anxiety (discorder) is: When we see anxiety as something negative, we force a stress reaction, that causes more anxiety. So if anxiety itself is relying on stress hormones and we force new stress hormones into our blood stream by judging a stress-induced feeling...we keep ourselves prisoner in this loop.**\\n\\nAs soon as we drop the judgment, the thoughts and feelings have no more power to cause a stress-reaction and anxiety.\\n\\nThe tool to reach this state of observation without judging, is **mindfulness.**\\n\\nI started with the HEADSPACE APP to learn the basics and started with silent sitting meditation soon after. This is where the real magic happens...when you are alone with yourself, in silence, \"looking\" at your thoughts and feelings.\\n\\nMindfulness is (imo) mandatory for the second tool: **ACCEPTANCE.**\\n\\nAs Carl Jung wrote: *\"What you resist, persists.\"*\\n\\nThis is a key element for overcoming anxiety. If you hate your anxiety and resist it with every part of your body and soul, it won\\'t go away. Not only that...it will grow!\\n\\nJust imagine your feelings like a river. As long as it can flow freely, there is no problem. But what happens, when you build a dam? The dam collects the water at a particular place...the water rises...the pressure rises. And that\\'s exactly what happens with anxiety. When you push it away and resist it, it will get bigger and the \"mental pressure\" rises.\\n\\nYOU HAVE TO LET IT FLOW!\\n\\nAnd to let it flow, you have to let go of your judgement about your thougts and about anxiety itself.Every negative judgement is a resistance that keeps you stuck in your anxiety.\\n\\nNegative judgements are not only mental...a big part is language.\\n\\n**How you speak ABOUT your anxiety, makes the difference, if you can get rid of your suffering or not.**\\n\\nIf you say something like *\"My anxiety is bad / horrible / gruesome.\"*, you are sending a signal to your subconscious mind, which will manipulate you behaviour in a way, in which you are starting to sabotage yourself.\\n\\nAnd this is part of the victim mentality. As long as you see yourself as a victim of external circumstances, you can\\'t change anything.\\n\\nWhy would you change something if you believe, that:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n1. there is no way out\\n2. It\\'s not your responsibility\\n\\nYou have to take control of your health and your live in general.\\n\\n**YOU** have to change. **YOU** have to call the shots!Nobody can do that for you.\\n\\nYes, you can get external Input, but **YOU** have to take the action.\\n\\nBut lets come to the most underrated topic, when it comes to anxiety.\\n\\n**Anxiety is not a mere mental construct. Anxiety can also happen on a physical base, without any mental factor.**\\n\\nA good example is caffeine. Caffeine will force your body into fight or flight mode, without any mental mechanism behind it.\\n\\nSome other factors that play in the same league:\\n\\n**Low blood sugar**\\n\\nWhere there is low blood sugar, there is CORTISOL. Cortisol causes the feeling of anxiety.\\n\\n**Free radicals**\\n\\nThere are certain foods, that can cause free radicals. When there are free radicals, there is stress and stress/stresshormones = anxiety\\n\\n**The earlier you understand, that anxiety is not always mental, the better.**\\n\\nThen there are certain factors, that are a threat, but wont get recognized as such.\\n\\n*What do i mean by that?*\\n\\nThere are certain fundamentals, that are necesary for life to exist.\\n\\n**WATER**\\n\\nNot much to write here. Drink enough water!\\n\\n**FOOD / NUTRIENTS**\\n\\nOur bodies need a full spectrum of nutrients. Without these nutrients, the body can\\'t function properly. With a typical western diet (fast food / nutrient deficient) there is a almost 100% guarantee, to suffer from (mental) illness at some point in life.\\n\\nYour body literally consists of the food you eat. When you eat garbage, your body consists of garbage.\\n\\nBut not only that: As i stated earlier, there are certain foods, that can cause anxiety by themselves. The foods are not healthy, and they are not natural.\\n\\n**LIGHT**\\n\\nVitamin D is a necessary nutrient our body produces, when we are out in the sun. The body also produces Melatonin, which is necessary for relaxing sleep.\\n\\nWhen we are deficient of sunlight, we are deficient in nutrients our bodies need to function properly.\\n\\n**MOVEMENT**\\n\\nYou have to see it this way: Our ancestors couldn\\'t order food over the phone. To eat, they had to hunt or collect food. They had to move! Without moving, they would die.\\n\\n**So lack of movement = life threatening.And remember: threat = anxiety!**\\n\\nWe are not finished...anxiety puts you into the so-called \"fight or flight mode\". What is the common ground between FIGHT and FLIGHT?\\n\\nMOVEMENT!\\n\\nAnxiety includes the mechanism to get rid of anxiety (stress hormones). To get rid of stress hormones, you have to move!\\n\\nBut what happens, when we suffer from anxiety in our modern society? When there is no \"real\" threat?There is no reason to fight or flee, so there is no movement.When there is no movement, stress hormones maintain in the blood stream, so anxiety can\\'t lift.\\n\\n**REGENERATION/SLEEP ROUTINES**\\n\\nYour body needs rest! 7-9 hours of sleep. Ban your mobile devices from your bed room!\\n\\nI’ve heard all sorts of methods to fall asleep faster &amp; get more quality sleep, but I’ve used &amp; continue to use [**The Chill Pill (highly recommend)**](https://deals.getchillpill.io/PH895DQ/24X9WZ1/?sub1=rlong)\\n\\nLong story short: The more natural your lifestyle, the better!\\n\\n**SPIRITUALITY**\\n\\nNever ever have i thought, that i would get \"all spiritual\", but spiritual teachings like Buddhism and Hinduism were a big influences on my way out of anxiety.\\n\\nDon\\'t be too narrow-minded and give it a try!\\n\\nBuddhism and Hinduism are literally dealing with these kind of issues (anxiety &amp; depression) successfully for over 1000 years.\\n\\nIf a doctor can\\'t help you or you don\\'t \"RESPECT THEIR AUTHORITAH\", try Buddhism/Hinduism. You won\\'t regret it!\\n\\nWith the help of this tools, i were back to normal after **\\\\~ 6 month – 1 year.**\\n\\n\"Back to normal\" is a mere understatement, because my change not only got rid of the anxiety, but brought a quality of life, i couldn\\'t even image BEFORE the anxiety disorder.\\n\\nThere is no solid time window...how long a person needs to get rid of his anxiety is totally up to im.\\n\\nHow much work does he/she invest?\\n\\nWhats his/her priorities?\\n\\nEtc.\\n\\n**TL;DR (How i got rid of my anxiety disorder)-Meditated 40-60 Minutes a day-Accepted my thoughts and feelings // dropped negative judgement of thoughts &amp; feelings-Changed my lifestyle (nutrient-dense foods, exercise, time in nature, quality sleep)**\\n\\nGood books:\\n\\nClaire Weekes – Hope and help for your nerves\\n\\nEckhart Tolle – The power of now\\n\\nDavid Hawkins – Letting go\\n\\nDr. Bulsiewicz – Fiber fueled\\n\\nPatrick McKeown – The oxygen advantage\\n\\nChristopher Ryan – Civilized to death\\n\\nMatthew Walker – Why we sleep',\n",

I show her the document I’m filling out. She suggests that I sign up for a follow up appointment after this is finished. I say “good idea, yes” or thereabouts. I do not look at her because I’m filling out the document and the official just did me a solid and got me out of paying a fine for being later than I was supposed to be.

We are both going directly home after this. Me finishing up took 10 minutes. \\n\\nI diagnose her with “holy fuck I’m pissed off, how dare you?!”. I’m not stranded, I can get home with public transport. But it’s a clear sign of passive aggressive offense. \\n\\nI apologise for being rude (“ignoring” her) immediately after arriving home because it’s best to get this out of the way asap. And off she goes, no acknowledgement of apologies, nothing. Just screaming that I’m taking my bad mood out on everyone around me. That I’m rude and she refuses to be in a bad mood just because I make everyone around me feel bad.\\n\\nTo clarify: Today I did not roll my eyes, sigh, shout, use expletives, be condescending, call people ugly, etc. My answers however were shorter than usual and I didn’t smile. At one point I did not make eye contact. \\n\\nSo! Hooray for parents who make your anxiety a horrific burden for them to carry. They are the sole victims and you are the abuser for not being very happy while in their presence. Just don’t be too happy.

Boyfriend in specific argues with anyone including friends if he has a reason to. At least twice to three times a week they\\'ll have a heated argument over nothing for a minimum of two hours. That alone turns my stomach and causes me anxiety because the topic is often about me and my \"flaws\". My mother is constantly pressuring me to get a job and yes I\\'m looking, but the one I had prior was still causing problems due to transportation. So it\\'s been a cycle of normal day, potential argument, me getting yelled at, feeling bad, repeat.\\n\\nI\\'ve been looking for jobs that are either close to me, or remote but customer service is off the table. I\\'m a social wreck who just wants something I can do with minimal interaction. \\n\\nTldr; I\\'m in a bad spot and need suggestions on employment.',\n",
